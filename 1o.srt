Dr. Oppenheimer.

00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,240
在我们开始前  我相信你想要宣读一份声明
As we begin, I believe you have a statement to read into the record.

41
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,040
是的  法官大人
Yes, your honor.

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,490
-我们不是法官  博士  -我明白
- We're not judges, Doctor. - No.

43
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,660
你们当然不是
Of course.

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,210

Members of the security board,

the so-called interrogatory information in your indictment of me

46
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,100
必须要结合我的工作与生活
cannot be fairly understood

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,140
才能被公正地理解
except in the context of my life, and my work.

48
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,430
他作证了多久
How long did he testify?

49
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,180
说实话  我忘了
Honestly, I forget.

50
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,450
整个听证会进行了一个月
The whole hearing took a month.

51
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,020
-简直是磨难  -我只读过文字记录
- An ordeal. - Oh, I've only read the transcripts.

52
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,080
-谁会想为自己的一生辩护呢  -你当时不在吗
- Who'd want to justify their whole life? - You weren't there?

53
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,120
作为主席  我不能参加
As chairman, I wasn't allowed to be.

54
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,490
他们真的会问这事吗
Are they really going to ask about it?

55
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,210
这已经是很多年前了
It was years ago.

56
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,080
-是四年前的事  -五年了
- Four years ago. - Five.

57
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,670
奥本海默仍然让美国分裂
Oppenheimer still divides America.

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,960
委员会肯定会问起你当时的立场的
The committee's going to want to know where you stood.

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,280
瑟蒙德参议员让我转告你  不要觉得自己在受审
Senator Thurmond asked me to say not to feel that you're on trial.

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,730
说来有趣  我本来没觉得  直到你提起
Oh, funny. I didn't, until you just said that.

61
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,440
-真的  施特劳斯先生  -是上将
- Really, Mr. Strauss... - It's Admiral.

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,690
上将  施特劳斯上将  这只是走个形式
Admiral. Admiral Strauss, this is a formality.

63
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,690
艾森豪威尔总统已经邀请您加入他的内阁
President Eisenhower has asked you to be in his cabinet.

64
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,690
参议院除了顺从他  别无选择
The Senate really has no choice but to confirm him.

65
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,060
那如果他们提起奥本海默呢
And if they bring up Oppenheimer?

66
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,320
如果他们提起奥本海默  你就如实回答
When they bring up Oppenheimer, you answer honestly,

67
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,950
你履行了职责  这一点没有任何参议员能否认
no senator can deny you did your duty.

68
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,900
只是会有点令人不适
It'll be uncomfortable.

69
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,360
毕竟谁会想为自己的一生辩护呢
Who'd want to justify their whole life?

70
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,620
你当初为什么离开美国
Why did you leave the United States?

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,430
我想去学最新的物理知识
I... I wanted to study the new physics.

72
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,960
在这里不能学吗
Was there nowhere here?

73
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,130
伯克利不就有一流的理论物理系吗
I thought Berkeley had the leading theoretical physics department.

74
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,800
是的  那是我创立的
Yes, once I built it.

75
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,270
但在那之前我得先去欧洲
But first I had to go to Europe.

76
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,520
我去了剑桥  师从帕特里克·布莱克特
I went to Cambridge, to study under Patrick Blackett.

77
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,970
比起在美国  你在那里是不是更开心
Were you happier there than in America?

78
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,560
-更开心  -没错
- Happier? - Yes.

79
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,570
不
No.

80
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,530
不  我当时
No, I, uh...

81
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,200
我当时很想家
I was homesick and...

82
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,990
情绪上也不成熟
emotionally immature...

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,870
总能看到某个隐藏的宇宙  因此深受困扰
Troubled by visions of a... hidden universe.

84
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,590
我在实验室一无是处
Useless in the lab.

85
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,980
天哪  奥本海默
Christ, Oppenheimer.

86
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,350
你昨晚没睡吗
Have you had any sleep?

87
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,860
重来
Start again.

88
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,730
我得去听讲座  老师
I need to go to a lecture, sir.

89
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,530
至于吗
Why?

90
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,490
是尼尔斯·玻尔的讲座
It's Niels Bohr.

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,660
我忘得一干二净
I completely forgot.

92
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,580
好了  咱们走
Alright! Let's go.

93
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,340
不  你不能去  奥本海默
Oh no, not you, Oppenheimer.

94
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,210
你镀完板子再走
You finish coating those plates.

95
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,800
量子物理不是向前迈出的一步
Quantum physics is not a step forward.

96
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,810
而是一种理解现实的全新方式
It is a new way to understand reality.

97
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,620
爱因斯坦打开了大门
Einstein's opened the door.

98
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,650
让人得以窥视我们所生活的世界中的另一个世界
Now we are peering through, seeing a world inside our world,

99
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:28,350
那里充斥着能量和悖论  并非所有人都能接受
a world of energy and paradox that not everyone can accept.

100
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,400
你没事吧
You alright?

101
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,870
尼尔斯  这位是J·罗伯特·奥本海默
Nils, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.

102
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,580
J代表什么
What's the J stand for?

103
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,950
没什么
Nothing, apparently.

104
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,510
你去听了我的讲座  问了全场唯一一个好问题
You were at my lecture. You asked the only good question.

105
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,070
没人否认他的洞察力
No one's denying his insight.

106
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,200
但他的实验室工作还有一些不足
It's his laboratory work that leaves a little to be desired.

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,880
我听说你之前也是那样回答的
I heard you give the same answer...

108
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,420
在哈佛  没错  而你问了同样的问题
At Harvard, yes, and you asked the same question.

109
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,800
为什么又问一遍
Why ask again?

110
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,330
我不喜欢你之前的回答
I hadn't liked your answer.

111
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,430
-那你对昨天的回答还满意吗  -很满意
- Did you like it better yesterday? - A lot.

112
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,890
即便没准备好应付石头下的蛇  你也可以抬起它
You can lift a stone without being ready for the snake that's revealed.

113
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,180
现在你似乎已经准备好了
Now it seems you're ready.

114
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,390
但你在实验室并不开心
But you don't enjoy the lab.

115
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,570
所以离开剑桥吧  离开那些烧杯和药水
So get out of Cambridge, with its beakers and potions.

116
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,230
去一个能让你思考的地方
Go somewhere they'll let you think.

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,310
是哪里呢
Where?

118
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,530
-哥廷根  -玻恩
- Göttingen. - Born.

119
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,620
玻恩
Born.

120
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,290
去德国  跟着马克斯·玻恩学习理论物理
Get to Germany, study under Max Born, learn the ways of theory.

121
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,820
我会跟他打招呼的
I'll send word.

122
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,780
有虫眼
Worm hole.

123
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,000
你的数学怎么样
How's your mathematics?

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,130
还没好到能支持他成为他想成为的物理学家
Not good enough for the physicist he wants to be.

125
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,470
代数就像乐谱
Algebra's like sheet music,

126
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,350
重要的不是你识不识谱  而是你能否听到音乐
the important thing isn't can you read music, it's can you hear it.

127
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,050
你能听到音乐吗  罗伯特
Can you hear the music, Robert?

128
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,220
是的  我能
Yes, I can.

129
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,360
怀俄明州参议员
The senator from Wyoming.

130
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,080
施特劳斯上将
Admiral Strauss,

131
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,410
我对您和J·罗伯特·奥本海默博士的关系很感兴趣
I'm interested in your relationship with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

132
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,700
你们在1947年相识
You met him in 1947.

133
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,370
是的
Correct.

134
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,290
你当时是原子能委员会的委员
You were a commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission.

135
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,050
是的  但我与罗伯特认识时
I was, but I actually met Robert in my capacity

136
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,750
我的身份是普林斯顿高等研究院的董事会成员
as board member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.

137
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,680
当时
It was...

138
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,100
正值战后  他已经是世界知名的伟大物理学家
after the war, he was world-renowned as the great man of physics,

139
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,310
我决心请他执掌研究院
and I was determined to get him to run the Institute.

140
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,950
奥本海默博士  幸会
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

141
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,120
你好  施特拉斯先生
Mr. Strauss.

142
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,690
应该是"施特劳斯"
It's pronounced "Strauss".

143
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,660
不管是"欧本海默"还是"奥本海默"
"Oppenheimer", "Oppenheimer"...

144
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,240
随便怎么读  对方都知道我是犹太人
Either way you say it, they know I'm Jewish.

145
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,880
我是曼哈顿以马内利会堂的会长
I'm president of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.

146
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,630
叫"施特劳斯"只是遵从南方的发音习惯而已
"Strauss" is just a Southern pronunciation.

147
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,630
总之  欢迎来到研究院  你在这应该会过得很开心
Anyway, welcome to the Institute. I think you'll be very happy here.

148
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,550
这里的通勤也很方便
Yes, well, you'll love the commute.

149
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,090
那栋房子就是为入职后的你准备的  你和你的妻子
The position comes with that house for you and your wife,

150
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,220
还有  两个孩子对吗
and your... is it two children?

151
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,270
没错  两个孩子
Yes, two.

152
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,180
我很敬仰你的工作
I'm a great admirer of your work.

153
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,690
你是科班出身的物理学家吗  施特劳斯先生
You're a physicist by training, Mr. Strauss?

154
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,770
抱歉  这里是公共休息室  茶点时间是四点
I'm sorry, uh, common room, four o'clock tea.

155
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,640
不  我没受过专业物理学训练
No, I'm not trained in physics or anything else.

156
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,610
我都是自学的
I'm a self-made man.

157
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,770
可以理解
Ah, I can relate to that.

158
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,360
-是吗  -我父亲也是
- Really? - Yes, my father was one.

159
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,480
这里就是你的办公室
And this would be your office.

160
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,830
听说下午他一般都在那里
I'm told he's there in most afternoons.

161
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,550
其实我一直很好奇
You know, I've always wondered

162
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,130
为什么你没有邀请他参加曼哈顿计划
why you didn't involve him in the Manhattan Project.

163
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,170
毕竟他是我们这个时代最伟大的科学家
Greatest scientific mind of our time.

164
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,710
是他那个时代
Of his time.

165
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,390
爱因斯坦发表相对论
Einstein published his Theory of Relativity

166
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,600
已经是40多年前的事了
more than 40 years ago now.

167
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,820
但他永远无法接受它所揭示的量子世界
Could never embrace the quantum world it revealed.

168
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,400
"上帝不会掷骰子"
"God doesn't play dice."

169
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,350
没错
Precisely.

170
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,160
你从没想过系统地学习物理吗  施特劳斯先生
You never thought of studying physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

171
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,280
曾有大学想录取我  但我选择了去卖鞋
I had offers, but... I chose to sell shoes.

172
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,360
路易斯·施特劳斯曾是个卑微的卖鞋人
Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe salesman.

173
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,910
不  就是个卖鞋人
No, just a shoe salesman.

174
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,540
-我很乐意介绍你们认识  -不必
- I'd love to introduce you. - No need.

175
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,910
我和他已经相识多年了
I've known him for years.

176
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,330
阿尔伯特
Albert.

177
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,860
他怎么那样  你对他说了什么
What was that? What did you say to him?

178
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,820
他没事
Oh, he's fine.

179
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,510
施特劳斯先生  我的一些过去  我想你有必要了解
Mr. Strauss, there are... things in my past you ought to be aware of.

180
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,260
作为原子能协会的主席
Well, as chairman of the AEC,

181
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,930
我已经读过了你的安全档案
I have access to your security file. I've read it.

182
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,350
-你不担忧吗  -不
- You're not worried? - No.

183
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,900
你已经为国家贡献了这么多  我有什么可担忧的
Why would I be worried, after everything you've done for your country?

184
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,140
时代变了  施特劳斯先生
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

185
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,890
这个研究院成立的目的
Well, the purpose of this institute

186
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,640
就是为独立思考的人才提供一个避难所
is to provide a haven for independent minds.

187
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,470
也就是你这种人
That's you.

188
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,600
这份工作  你是完美人选
You are the man for the job.

189
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,600
容我考虑一下
Well, then I'll consider it.

190
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,350
明天原子能委员会的例会上见吧
I'll see you at the AEC meeting tomorrow.

191
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,620
这是本国声望最高的职位之一
This is one of the most prestigious appointments in the country.

192
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,910
是的  而且通勤也很方便
Yes, and a great commute.

193
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,990
所以我才在考虑
That's why I'm considering it.

194
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,990
所以奥本海默博士在你任命他前  就已经提醒过你
So Dr. Oppenheimer brought your attention to his past associations

195
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,510
关于他过去结识的人的问题
before you appointed him?

196
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,710
是的
Yes.

197
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,380
而当时这并没有引起你的注意
And they didn't concern you?

198
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,310
当时我一心琢磨
Just then I was entirely consumed with

199
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,710
他到底对爱因斯坦说了什么  后者才对我没好气
what he must have said to Einstein to sour him on me.

200
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,510
那之后呢
But later?

201
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,680
之后发生的事  我们都很清楚
Well, we all know what happened later.

202
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,940
博士  你在欧洲的这段时间
Doctor, your time in Europe,

203
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,110
似乎认识了很多别国的物理学家
you seem to meet with a wide range of other countries' physicists.

204
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,320
是的  没错
Yes, that's right.

205
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,730
有苏联人吗
Any Russians?

206
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,910
据我所知应该没有
None that spring to mind.

207
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,040
-请允许我继续读我的声明...  -罗伯先生
- If you'll just allow me to continue with my statement... - Mr. Robb,

208
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,110
你会有足够的机会交叉询问的
you'll have ample opportunity to cross-examine.

209
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,500
离开哥廷根后  我搬到了荷兰的莱顿
After Göttingen, I moved on to Leiden, in Holland,

210
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,910
在那里我第一次见到了伊西多·拉比
where I first met Isidor Rabi.

211
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,750
借过
Excuse me.

212
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,970
一个美国佬来讲最新的物理学知识
A yank. Lecturing on the new physics.

213
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,900
这我可得听听
This I have to hear.

214
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,930
毕竟我就是美国人
I'm an American myself.

215
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,840
真是令人惊讶呢
How surprising.

216
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,100
如果他说的英语你有哪里听不懂  尽可以问我
Let me know if you need any help with the English.

217
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,940
α粒子和原子撞击
Bij de botsing tussen een alfadeeltje en een atoom,

218
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,500
此过程中产生的能量  特别是相对平移能
veranderen de verschillende energieën de verbindingssoort,

219
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,570
-会改变键能  -等等  他说的什么
- met name in de relatieve translatie. - Wait, what's he saying?

220
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,750
不用了  谢谢
No, thank you.

221
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,540
到苏黎世的路很远
It's a long way to Zurich.

222
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,520
你再瘦一点的话
If you get any skinnier,

223
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,510
就掉进坐垫缝里了
we're gonna lose you between the seat cushions.

224
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,180
-我是拉比  -奥本海默
- I'm Rabi. - Oppenheimer.

225
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,430
我听了你关于分子的讲座
I caught your lecture on molecules.

226
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,050
听懂了一部分
Caught some of it.

227
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,350
我俩都是纽约来的犹太人  为什么你懂荷兰语
We're a couple of New York Jews, how do you know Dutch?

228
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,030
我这学期到这里的时候  觉得还是最好学一下
Well, I thought I'd better learn it when I got here this semester.

229
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,460
你用六周  就把荷兰语学到了
You learned enough Dutch in six weeks

230
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,450
能讲量子力学课的程度
to give a lecture on quantum mechanics?

231
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,990
我喜欢挑战自我
I like to challenge myself.

232
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,280
量子物理还不够挑战是吧
Quantum physics wasn't challenging enough.

233
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,990
-爱炫耀  -什么意思
- Shvitzer. - Shvitzer?

234
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,240
说你爱出风头
Show-off.

235
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,660
虽然你六周就学会了荷兰语  但你不懂意第绪语
Dutch in six weeks, but you never learned Yiddish.

236
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,870
纽约我们那一区可没什么人说这种语言
They don't speak it so much my side of the park.

237
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,240
去你的
Screw you.

238
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,040
-你想家吗  -你懂的
- You homesick? - Oh, you know it.

239
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,120
你有没有觉得我们这种人在这边不太受欢迎
Ever get the feeling our kind isn't entirely welcome here?

240
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,330
你说物理学家吗
Physicists?

241
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,170
-真好笑  -在系里没觉得
- That's funny. - Not in the department.

242
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,420
他们也全是犹太人
They're all Jewish, too.

243
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,630
吃吧
Eat.

244
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,000
你必须去找那个德国人
There's this German you have to seek out.

245
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,890
-海森堡  -对
- Heisenberg. - Right.

246
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,750
人们可能会认为  在量子世界的背后
One might be led to the presumption that behind the quantum world

247
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,270
仍然隐藏着一个存在因果关系的真实世界
there still hides a real world in which causality holds,

248
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:32,050
但直白说  这种猜测在我们看来做不出成果
but such speculations seem to us, to say it explicitly, fruitless.

249
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,000
谢谢  祝各位今天愉快
Thank you. Have a great day.

250
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,890
-太好了  -谢谢
- Wonderful. - Thank you.

251
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,140
-奥本海默博士  -奥本海默  没错
- Dr. Oppenheimer. - Oppenheimer, yes!

252
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,980
我喜欢你关于分子的论文
I liked your paper on molecules.

253
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,520
很可能是因为你启发了我
Probably because you inspired it.

254
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,160
如果我还给了你其他启发  不妨告诉我
If I inspire anything else, let me know.

255
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,480
我们可以一起发表
We could publish together.

256
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,150
-我必须回美国  -为什么
- I have to get back to America. - Why?

257
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,030
那里没人把量子力学当回事
There's no one there taking quantum mechanics seriously.

258
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,730
正是这个原因
That's exactly why.

259
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,490
他想念曼哈顿的峡谷
He's pining for the canyons of Manhattan.

260
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,540
是新墨西哥州的峡谷
Canyons of New Mexico.

261
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,370
-你来自新墨西哥州吗  -不  纽约
- You're from New Mexico? - No, New York.

262
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,270
但我弟弟和我在圣达菲郊外有一个牧场
But my brother and I have a ranch outside Santa Fe.

263
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,840
此刻我想念那样的美国
That's the America I miss right now.

264
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,870
那就回家吧  两位牛仔
Then it's best you get home, cowboys.

265
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,340
他才是
That's him.

266
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,130
我和马
No, me and horses?

267
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,430
我可不喜欢
I don't think so.

268
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,580
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you.

269
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,770
你后来还见过海森堡吗
Did you ever encounter Heisenberg again?

270
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,680
没会过面  不过
Not in person, no, but...

271
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,350
我们的人生算是有过交集
you might say our paths crossed.

272
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,990
回到美国后
On returning to America,

273
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,950
我同时在加州理工和伯克利任教
I accepted positions at both Caltech and up at Berkeley.

274
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,750
是劳伦斯博士吧
Dr. Lawrence, I presume?

275
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,810
你一定是奥本海默
You must be Oppenheimer.

276
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,920
是的
Yes.

277
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,480
我听说你想开设量子理论学院
I hear you want to start a school of quantum theory.

278
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,100
没错  就在隔壁
I am starting it, next door.

279
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,480
-他们安排的吗  -我申请的
- They put you in there? - I asked for it.

280
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,570
想离你们实验物理学家更近一些
Wanted to be close to you experimentalists.

281
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,610
理论是有局限的
Theory will get you only so far.

282
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,780
我们正在造一台加速电子的机器
We're building a machine to accelerate electrons.

283
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,820
了不起
Magnificent.

284
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,160
你愿意帮忙吗
Would you like to help?

285
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,990
帮忙造它  不了  不了
Build it? Oh, no. No, no.

286
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,830
但我愿意用它检验我正在研究的理论
But I am working on theories I'd like to test with it.

287
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,120
你什么时候开始教书
When do you start teaching?

288
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,790
一小时后开始上第一节课
I've got my first in an hour.

289
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,990
-研讨课吗  -一个学生
- Seminar? - Pupil.

290
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,830
一个学生  就一个吗
One student? That's it?

291
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,720
我教的是这里没人敢想的东西
I'm teaching something no one here has dreamt of.

292
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
但一旦人们知道你能用它做什么
But once people start hearing what you can do with it...

293
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,210
就不可能回头了
There's no going back.

294
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,130
-我一定是错过了...  -洛马尼茨先生
- Oh, I must have missed the... - Mr. Lomanitz?

295
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,900
-是我  -对  就是这里
- Yeah. - Yes, this is it.

296
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,140
请坐
Please, take a seat.

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,190
你对量子力学了解多少
What do you know about quantum mechanics?

298
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,560
我掌握了基础知识
I have a grasp on the basics.

299
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,230
那你就做错了
Then you're doing it wrong.

300
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,400
生命是由粒子还是波构成的
Is life made up of particles or waves?

301
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,910
量子力学说两者都是
Quantum mechanics says it's both.

302
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,160
怎么可能两者都是呢
How can it be both?

303
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,620
-不可能  -不可能
- It can't. - It can't.

304
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,170
但的确如此
But it is.

305
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,000
自相矛盾  但是成立
It's paradoxical, and yet, it works.

306
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,550
谢谢
Thank you.

307
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,100
洛马尼茨先生  你不会有事的
Mr. Lomanitz. You're gonna be okay.

308
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,470
斯奈德先生
Mr. Snyder.

309
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,770
想象一颗恒星
Now, let's consider a star.

310
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,030
恒星  在外太空中燃烧的巨大熔炉
A star, a vast furnace burning in outer space,

311
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,520
火焰克服自身的引力向外推  保持平衡
fire pushing outwards against its own gravity, balanced.

312
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,880
但是如果那个熔炉冷却了
But if that furnace cools,

313
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,000
引力开始占据上风  它会收缩
and gravity starts winning, it contracts.

314
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,420
-密度增加  -对
- Density increases. - Correct.

315
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,080
-引力增强  -密度增加
- Increasing gravity. - Increasing density.

316
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,380
-然后呢  -这是一个恶性循环  直到
- And? - It's a vicious cycle until...

317
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,530
何时会达到极限
What's the limit here?

318
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,320
我不知道  看看数学怎么回答
I don't know. See where the math takes us.

319
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,390
我保证这是一个没人探索过的领域
I guarantee it's somewhere no one's been before us.

320
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,500
我吗
Me?

321
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,030
对  你  你的数学比我好
Yes, you. Your math is better than mine.

322
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,730
奥本海默博士的档案
Dr. Oppenheimer's file

323
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,400
包含了他在伯克利活动的细节
contained details of his activities at Berkeley.

324
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,120
为什么战前就建了他的档案
Why would they have started a file on Dr. Oppenheimer before the war?

325
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,400
你得去问胡佛先生
Well, you'd have to ask Mr. Hoover.

326
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,820
我在问你  施特劳斯上将
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

327
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,570
我猜测
Uh, my assumption

328
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,370
这和他参与
is that it was connected to his, uh,

329
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,850
左翼的政治活动有关
left-wing political activities.

330
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,020
你不应该让他们把政治带进课堂  奥比
You shouldn't let them bring their politics in the classroom, Oppie.

331
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,450
那是我写的
I wrote that.

332
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,130
劳伦斯  你欣然接受了物理学的革命
Lawrence, you embraced the revolution in physics.

333
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,000
却看不到别处的革命吗
Can't you see it everywhere else?

334
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,470
毕加索  斯特拉文斯基  弗洛伊德  马克思
Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx.

335
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,590
这是美国  奥比  我们经历过革命了
Well, this is America, Oppie. We had our revolution.

336
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,220
说真的  别带进实验室来
Seriously, keep it out of the lab.

337
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,060
好吧  实验室外
Well, out of the lab

338
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,360
我的女房东今晚要办小组讨论
my landlady is having a discussion group tonight.

339
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,190
感兴趣吗
Interested?

340
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,960
我随机调查过伯克利的政治圈子
I have sampled the Berkeley political scene.

341
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,320
全是哲学研究生和共产主义者
It's all just philosophy post-grads and communists

342
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,530
讨论取消种族隔离
talking integration.

343
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,030
你不关心取消种族隔离这件事吗
You don't care about integration?

344
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,120
我想投票支持  不想张嘴讨论
I want to vote for it, not talk about it.

345
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,700
今天周五就更不想了  来吧  吃饭去
Especially on a Friday. Come on, let's eat.

346
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,330
我弟弟到时候也会去
I'm meeting my brother there.

347
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,540
这些活动是如何引起了联调局的注意呢
And how would these activities have come to the attention of the FBI?

348
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,500
如果我没记错的话
Well, if I remember correctly,

349
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
在数次疑似共产主义者集会外
the FBI was taking license plates

350
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,690
联调局抄写了车牌号
outside suspected communist gatherings,

351
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,750
他的名字就浮现了
and his name popped up.

352
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,640
-天哪  -抱歉
- Jesus Christ! - Sorry.

353
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,800
弗兰克
Frank!

354
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,890
-你记得杰姬吗  -晚上好
- Uh, you remember Jackie? - Evening.

355
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,660
罗伯特  我想给你介绍薛瓦利埃
Robert! I want you to meet Chevalier.

356
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,700
哈康·薛瓦利埃博士  罗伯特·奥本海默博士
Dr. Haakon Chevalier, Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

357
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,330
-幸会  -幸会
- Pleasure. - Pleasure.

358
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,410
这是我的弟弟弗兰克
This is my little brother, Frank.

359
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,420
-这位是...  -还是杰姬
- And this is... - Still Jackie.

360
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,670
你好  "还是杰姬"
Hello, Still Jackie.

361
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,170
薛瓦利埃  你在语言学院吗
Chevalier, you're in languages?

362
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,500
而你声名在外
And your reputation precedes you.

363
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,630
你听说了什么
What have you heard?

364
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,770
说你在教一种我不可能理解的
That you're teaching a radical new approach to physics

365
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,150
全新的物理学方法
I have no chance of understanding,

366
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,050
但我没听说你是党员
but I haven't heard you're a party member.

367
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,850
-我不是  -目前还不是
- Uh, I'm not. - Oh, not yet.

368
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,340
我和弗兰克在考虑入党
Frank and I are thinking of joining.

369
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,670
-前几天我还说呢...  -我支持很多事业
- Just the other day I was saying... - I support a range of causes.

370
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,020
西班牙内战
Spanish Civil War?

371
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,850
法西斯暴徒推翻了民主共和国
A democratic republic being overthrown by fascist thugs.

372
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,270
-谁不支持呢  -我们的政府
- Who wouldn't? - Our government.

373
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,070
他们认为社会主义比法西斯主义更具威胁
They think that socialism is a bigger threat than fascism.

374
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,650
很快就不会了  看看纳粹是怎么对犹太人的
Not for long. Look at what the Nazis are doing to the Jews.

375
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,490
我给德国的同事汇款  助其移民国外
I send funds to colleagues in Germany to emigrate.

376
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,150
我必须做点什么
I have to do something.

377
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,920
我自己的研究...太抽象了
My own work is so... abstract.

378
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,030
你在研究什么
What are you working on?

379
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,370
恒星死后会发生什么
What happens to stars when they die?

380
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,240
恒星会死吗
Do stars die?

381
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,600
如果恒星死亡  它们会冷却  接着坍缩
Well, if they do, they'd cool, then collapse.

382
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,080
实际上  恒星越大
In fact, the bigger the star,

383
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,710
它们的终结越为猛烈
the more violent its demise.

384
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,500
引力变得极度集中  将一切都吞噬
Their gravity gets so concentrated, it swallows everything.

385
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,500
一切  甚至是光
Everything, even light.

386
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,430
-这真的会发生吗  -数学说可以
- Can that really happen? - The math says it can.

387
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,580
如果我们能发表论文
If we can get published,

388
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,640
也许有天  天文学家就能找到一例
then perhaps one day an astronomer finds one.

389
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,400
但目前  我只有理论
But right now, all I have is theory,

390
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,440
无法影响人们的生活
which can't impact people's lives.

391
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,650
如果你要往西班牙汇款
Well, if you're going to send money to Spain,

392
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,190
可以通过共产党
do it through the Communist Party.

393
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,520
他们可以把钱送到前线
They can get it to the front lines.

394
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,270
玛丽让我拿这些过来
Mary sent me with these.

395
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,450
-我叫吉恩  -罗伯特
- I'm Jean. - Robert.

396
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,540
哈康·薛瓦利埃
Haakon Chevalier.

397
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,450
上个月在希尔博家的工会会议上见过
That union meeting at Serber's last month.

398
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,360
没错  没错
Right, right, yes.

399
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,790
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

400
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,830
罗伯特说他不是共产党
Robert here says he's not a communist.

401
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,130
说明他还不够了解共产党
Well, then he doesn't know enough about it.

402
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,790
我读过《资本论》  全部三卷
Oh, I've read Das Kapital, all three volumes.

403
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,760
这算吗
Does that count?

404
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,880
这说明你比大多数党员更博览群书
It would make you better-read than most party members.

405
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,350
挺晦涩的  有一个观点...
Turgid stuff. There's some thinking, um...

406
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,930
"所有权就是偷窃"
"Ownership is theft."

407
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,930
-财产  -财产
- Property. - Property?

408
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,270
是财产  不是所有权
Property, not ownership.

409
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,890
不好意思  我读的是德语原文
I'm sorry, I read it in the original German.

410
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,530
书不重要  重要的是想法
It's not about the book. It's about the ideas.

411
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,510
你听起来并不笃定
And you sound uncommitted.

412
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,230
我笃定的是自由思考如何让我们的世界更好
I'm committed to thinking freely about how to improve our world.

413
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,820
为什么要把自己局限于一个教条呢
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

414
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,530
你是物理学家  你会对规律挑挑拣拣吗
You're a physicist. Do you pick and choose rules?

415
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,950
还是利用规律  引导能量  取得进步
Or do you use the discipline to channel your energies into progress?

416
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,910
我喜欢有一点回旋空间
I like a little wiggle room.

417
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,830
你总是遵守党的路线吗
Do you always toe the party line?

418
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,500
我也喜欢回旋空间
I like my wiggle room, too.

419
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,090
怎么了
What?

420
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,390
等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait.

421
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,480
没想到啊
Unexpected.

422
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,850
什么
What?

423
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,110
你不是物理学家吗
For a physicist.

424
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,780
你只有一架子弗洛伊德的书吗
You only have a shelf full of Freud?

425
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,780
-实际上  我更偏向...  -荣格学派
- Well, actually, my background's more... - Jungian?

426
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,000
你知道分析心理学
You know analysis?

427
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
我在剑桥读研究生的时候
When I was in post-grad at Cambridge,

428
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,740
我遇到了一些小麻烦
I had a little trouble.

429
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,050
-是嘛  -我试图毒害我的导师
- I'll bite. - I tried to poison my tutor.

430
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,710
-你恨他吗  -我非常喜欢他
- Did you hate him? - I liked him very much.

431
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,430
你只是需要跟人上床
You just needed to get laid.

432
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,940
我的心理医生们花了两年时间
It took my analysts two years,

433
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,260
可能都没有如此一针见血
and I don't think they ever put it that succinctly.

434
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,780
你让所有人相信
You have everyone convinced

435
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,100
你是个"复杂"的人
you're more complicated than you actually are.

436
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,520
我们都是简单的人  我猜
We're all simple souls, I guess.

437
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,760
我不是
I'm not.

438
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,400
这是什么
What's this?

439
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,730
梵语
Sanskrit.

440
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,310
你读得懂
You can read this?

441
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,850
我在学
I'm learning.

442
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,360
读读看
Read this.

443
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,200
在这一部分
Well, in this part,

444
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,620
-毗湿奴展现了他多臂的自我...  -不
- Vishnu reveals his multi-armed self... - No.

445
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,200
读原文
Read the words.

446
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,330
"如今  我已成为死神"
"And now I am become Death...

447
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,340
"世界的毁灭者"
"destroyer of worlds."

448
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,430
这里就行
This'll do.

449
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,050
黎明前风会停的
It'll break before dawn.

450
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,840
夜间气温下降
Air cools overnight.

451
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,930
就在天亮之前  风会停下来
Just before dawn, it breaks.

452
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,490
我要结婚了
Well, so, I'm getting married.

453
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,200
-弗兰克  恭喜你  -谢谢  谢谢
- Frank! Congratulations! - Thank you, thank you.

454
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,990
-和杰姬吗  -是的  杰姬
- To Jackie? - Yeah, to Jackie.

455
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,860
那个服务员
The waitress?

456
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,700
奥比  被你说中了  风变小了
Oppie, you're right. It's letting up.

457
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,660
我出去看看有没有星星
I'm gonna go see if there's any stars.

458
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,240
你总说普通民众怎样怎样
All your talk about the common man,

459
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,450
但你还是看不上杰姬  是不是
but Jackie's not good enough for you, hmm?

460
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,050
听说我们入党  你的失望藏都藏不住
We joined the party, and you can't hide your disappointment.

461
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,300
为什么  因为你才有资格做这种大事是吗
Why? Is that because that's supposed to be your thing?

462
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,970
我还没有入党  弗兰克
I haven't joined the party, Frank.

463
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,260
我认为她也不应该劝你入党
And I don't think she should have convinced you to either.

464
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,210
-系里教职工一半都是党员  -没那么多
- Half of the faculty is communist. - Not that half.

465
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,520
我是你哥哥  弗兰克  我想让你谨慎点
I'm your brother, Frank, and I want you to be cautious.

466
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,350
我还想拧断你的脖子呢
And I want to wring your neck.

467
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,690
我不想一辈子都过得谨小慎微
I won't live my life afraid to make a mistake.

468
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,780
你幸福  我就幸福
You're happy... I'm happy.

469
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,320
你能为我而幸福  我就幸福
So then I'm happy you're happy that I'm happy.

470
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,410
我甚至觉得能看到暗星  就是你研究的那种
I feel like I can see one of those dark stars that you're working on.

471
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,040
看不到的
You can't.

472
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,830
所以才叫"暗"星  它们的引力能吞噬光线
That's the whole point. Their gravity swallows light.

473
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,420
就像宇宙中的一个洞
It's like a kind of hole in space.

474
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,310
弗兰克还好吗
Is Frank okay?

475
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,050
好  只不过他哥太差劲了
Yes. He just has a shitty brother.

476
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,550
这里确实特别
It is special here.

477
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,180
我小时候
When I was a kid...

478
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,220
就想  要是我能找到办法
I thought if I could find a way...

479
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,480
将物理和新墨西哥州结合起来
to combine physics and New Mexico,

480
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,360
我的人生就完美了
my life would be perfect.

481
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,740
-说这话还为时过早  -是啊
- Little remote for that. - Yes.

482
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,490
去睡一会儿吧
Let's get some sleep.

483
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,370
我们今天看到的那座平顶山
That mesa we saw today,

484
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,660
是我在这世上最喜欢的地方之一
one of my favorite places in the world.

485
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,950
-明天我们去爬  -那山叫什么名字
- Tomorrow we'll climb it. - What's it called?

486
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,750
洛斯阿拉莫斯
Los Alamos.

487
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,550
我今天没想到要见你
I didn't expect to see you today.

488
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,420
我还得先预约吗
Do I have to make an appointment?

489
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,680
阿尔瓦雷茨
Alvarez?

490
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,110
奥比  奥比
Oppie! Oppie!

491
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,190
什么  怎么了
What? What is it?

492
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,440
他们成功了
They've done it.

493
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,290
他们成功了  德国的哈恩和斯特拉斯曼
They've done it. Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.

494
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,110
他们让铀核裂变了
They split the uranium nucleus.

495
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,700
怎么做到的
How?

496
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,920
用中子轰击铀核
Bombard it with neutrons.

497
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,340
这是核裂变
It's a nuclear fission.

498
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,750
他们做到了  他们分裂了原子
They did it. They split the atom.

499
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,250
这不可能
That's not possible.

500
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,090
我去尝试复制实验
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

501
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,970
看到没  不可能做到
See? Can't be done.

502
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,220
方法优雅
Very elegant.

503
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,350
过程清楚
Quite clear.

504
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,570
只是有一个问题
There's just one problem.

505
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:26,690
哪里
Where?

506
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,310
隔壁
Next door.

507
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,230
阿尔瓦雷茨成功了
Alvarez did it.

508
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,360
看
And look.

509
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,070
这些裂变脉冲  非常强烈
These fission pulses, they're massive.

510
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,740
过去十分钟里我看到了三十次
I've seen 30 of these in the past ten minutes.

511
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,700
理论是有局限的
Theory will take you only so far.

512
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,460
在这一过程中
During the process...

513
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,970
裂变释放出的中子能量极高
extra neutrons boil off,

514
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,180
可以再去分裂其他的铀原子核
which could be used to split other uranium atoms.

515
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,590
链式反应
Chain reaction.

516
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,220
你跟我想的一样吗
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

517
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,220
不止你我  世上所有看到这篇报道的物理学家
You, me, and every other physicist around the world

518
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,760
都会这么想
who's seen the news.

519
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,510
我怎么不...你们在说什么
I just... what, what are we all thinking?

520
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,850
炸弹  阿尔瓦雷茨
A bomb, Alvarez.

521
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,270
做炸弹
A bomb.

522
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,060
我告诉过你  罗伯特  别他妈再送花了
I told you, Robert, no more fucking flowers.

523
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,120
我不懂  你到底要我怎样
I don't understand what you want from me.

524
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,030
我什么也不要
I don't want anything from you!

525
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,120
-说是这么说  却又打电话找我  -你别接啊
- Well, you say that, and then you call. - Well, don't answer.

526
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,540
你打来我一定会接的
I'll always answer.

527
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,830
行吧
Fine.

528
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,920
别再送花就行了
Just no more flowers.

529
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,230
你不来吗
You're not coming?

530
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,550
要知难而退啊  罗伯特
You have to know when you're beaten, Robert.

531
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,590
没那么简单  哈康
It's not that simple, Haak.

532
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,170
薛瓦利埃  你好  芭芭拉  你好
Chevalier, good to see you. It's O...Barbara, good to see you.

533
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,670
还有声名远扬的奥本海默博士
And the illustrious Dr. Oppenheimer.

534
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,410
-我是埃尔滕顿  -幸会
- I'm Eltenton. - Oh, pleasure.

535
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,370
请进
Please, please.

536
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,790
大学里成立劳工组织的事  你来讲两句吧
Why don't you say a word about organized labor on campuses?

537
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,180
好吗  请让一让  让一让
Yes? Coming through, coming through!

538
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,250
我在壳牌工作
I work at Shell.

539
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,630
化学家和工程师都加入了组织
We've signed up chemists, we've signed up engineers.

540
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,750
科学界和学术界人士也一起吧
So why not sciences and academia?

541
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:10,900
奥比  奥比  奥比  奥比
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

542
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,510
讲师都加入了
Teachers are unionized.

543
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,470
教授为什么不呢
Why not professors?

544
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,710
你不是还有事吗
Don't you have somewhere to be?

545
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,150
劳伦斯  科研人士也有权利
Lawrence, academics have rights too.

546
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,540
我不是说那个  我有个组会要开
Look, it's not that. I've got a group coming.

547
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,250
-那我旁听  -这次不行
- I'll sit in. - Not this one.

548
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,750
理查德  布什博士
Richard, Dr. Bush.

549
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,370
二位怎么北上来这里了
What brings you two up north?

550
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,980
理查德  你转告露丝  我周四去帕萨迪纳
Richard, you tell Ruth I'll be down in Pasadena Thursday.

551
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,870
黑洞的文章  中了
Paper on black holes, it's in!

552
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,670
哈特兰在哪儿
Where's Hartland?

553
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,420
找一下哈特兰  去找他
Get Hartland. Get Hartland.

554
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,160
1939年9月1日  世界会铭记这一天
September 1st, 1939? The world's gonna remember this day.

555
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,690
哈特兰  我们的论文刊印出来了
Oh, Hartland, our paper, it's in print.

556
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,120
有人抢了你的风头
You've been upstaged.

557
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,830
在不列颠战役期间  我发现
During the Battle of Britain, I found myself

558
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,540
自己越来越难以认同
increasingly out of sympathy with the...

559
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,960
共产党人主张的中立政策
policy of neutrality that communists advocated.

560
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,840
但希特勒入侵苏联后  我们与苏联成了盟友
But after Hitler invaded Russia and we became allies,

561
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,520
你对共产党人的认同有没有回升
these communist sympathies, do they return?

562
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,500
没有
No.

563
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,370
我得声明一下
I need to make clear that

564
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,050
我改变了对苏联的看法
my changing views on Russia did not mean

565
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,880
并不意味着我会与其他持不同观点的人绝交
a sharp break from those who held different views.

566
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,520
我妻子吉蒂在之前的一段婚姻中
For a year or two during a previous marriage,

567
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,780
当过一两年共产党员
my wife Kitty had been a Communist Party member.

568
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,930
我把好东西都藏在这里
This is where I keep the good stuff.

569
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,780
这里不是托尔曼夫妇家吗
Well, I thought this was the Tolmans' house.

570
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,920
我在加州理工的时候就住他们家
I live with them while I'm at Caltech.

571
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,480
你俩需要我帮忙吗
Do you two need anything?

572
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,700
不用  露丝
We're good, Ruthie.

573
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,970
话说  你是一名生物学家
So, you're a biologist.

574
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,340
但我毕业之后就当了家庭主妇
Well, somehow I have graduated to housewife.

575
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,970
你能给我讲讲量子力学吗
Can you explain quantum mechanics to me?

576
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,780
-听起来挺玄乎的  -确实
- Seems baffling. - Yes, it is.

577
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,780
这个杯子
Well, this glass,

578
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,990
杯中的酒  这个台面
this drink... this countertop...

579
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,370
还有我们的身体
Our bodies.

580
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,120
一切的一切
All of it.

581
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,070
几乎都是空的
It's mostly empty space.

582
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,560
是束缚在一起的一组组微小能量波
Groupings of tiny energy waves bound together.

583
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,500
被什么束缚
By what?

584
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,810
足够强的吸引力
Forces of attraction strong enough

585
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:44,000
强到能让我们认为物质是固体
to convince us that matter is solid.

586
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,400
让我的身体不会穿过你的身体
Stop my body passing through yours.

587
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,410
你跟哈里森博士是夫妻
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

588
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,130
聚少离多
Not very.

589
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,870
有一个人  我对她...
There is someone that I feel...

590
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,380
她对你也是一样吗
Does she feel that way?

591
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,830
有时吧
Sometimes.

592
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,510
不够多
Not enough.

593
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,780
我要去新墨西哥州了
You know, I'm going to New Mexico.

594
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,230
去我的牧场  跟朋友们一起
To my ranch, with friends.

595
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,280
你也来吧
You should come.

596
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,880
我是说  和你丈夫一起
I meant, with your husband.

597
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,340
是啊
Yes, you did.

598
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,130
你明知道加不加这句话  结果都一样
Because you know it won't make a bit of difference.

599
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,890
你为什么嫁给他
Why did you marry him?

600
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,500
我那时很迷茫  他很温柔
I was lost, and... he was kind.

601
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,760
迷茫
Lost?

602
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,710
我上一任丈夫去世了
Well, my previous husband had died, and...

603
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,590
28岁的我毫无准备就当了寡妇
at 28, I wasn't really ready to be a widow.

604
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,840
-你第一任丈夫是谁  -无名小卒
- Who was your first husband? - Nobody.

605
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,360
我第二任丈夫是乔·达莱特
My second husband was Joe Dallet.

606
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,630
他跟我一样也出身富裕
He was from money, like me,

607
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,290
但他当时是俄亥俄州扬斯敦的工会组织者
but he was a union organizer in Youngstown, Ohio.

608
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,510
我爱得疯狂
I fell hard.

609
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,390
-有多疯狂  -在接下来的四年里
- How hard? - Hard enough to spend the next four years

610
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,700
甘愿仅靠豆子和煎饼果腹
living off beans and pancakes,

611
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,200
在工厂门口发《每日工人》的那种疯狂
handing out the Daily Worker at factory gates.

612
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,560
到1936年  我对乔说  我再也受不了了
By '36, I just told Joe I couldn't take it anymore.

613
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,760
我退了党
Quit the party.

614
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,300
一年之后  我又想跟他复合
A year later, I wanted him back.

615
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,550
只要他  不要《每日工人》  然后...
Him, not the Daily Worker. And...

616
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,090
他说  "好啊  我们去西班牙的路上见"
he said: "Swell, I'll meet you on my way to Spain."

617
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,380
去为忠诚派而战吗
Went to fight for the Loyalists?

618
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,450
然后他去参军了  我等啊等
And then he went to the brigades and I waited.

619
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,610
然后
And...

620
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,110
他上战场后
Joe got himself killed

621
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,310
第一次从战壕探头就丢了命
first time he popped his head out of the trench.

622
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,090
意识形态害死了乔  毫无意义
Ideology got Joe killed, for nothing.

623
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,850
西班牙共和国可不是毫无意义
The Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

624
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,540
我丈夫赔上我们两人的未来
My husband offered both our futures

625
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,170
换来一颗本该射进泥滩的法西斯子弹击中他自己
to stop one fascist bullet from embedding itself in a mud bank.

626
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,340
这就是毫无意义
That's the definition of nothing.

627
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,600
-有点过于简化了  -是务实
- Seems a little reductive. - Pragmatic.

628
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,580
结果我就落得这个境地了
Now here I am.

629
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,830
管它现在是什么情况
Wherever the hell this is.

630
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,870
我不希望你从别人口中听说
I didn't want you to hear it from anyone else.

631
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,790
至少这次你没再送我花
At least you didn't bring me flowers.

632
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,630
我们心里都清楚  你想要的不是我  吉恩
We both know I'm not what you want, Jean.

633
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,860
对  可是以后我俩再也没可能了
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

634
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,360
不
No.

635
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,520
至少我不这么认为
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

636
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,410
你这就让她怀上了  动作够快
You knocked her up. Fast work.

637
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,150
好男人是很抢手
Can't keep a good man down.

638
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,590
我是说她
I meant her.

639
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,880
她知道她想要什么
She knew what she wanted.

640
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,440
她丈夫怎么办
What about the husband?

641
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,540
我们聊过了
We talked.

642
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,470
他们打算离婚
They're getting a divorce,

643
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,350
这样我俩就能赶在她显怀之前结婚
so we can get married before she starts showing.

644
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,200
真体面啊
How civilized.

645
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,230
你个傻子
You idiot.

646
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,230
这是你们科学家的圈子
This is your community.

647
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,440
你以为天才就能藐视规律了吗
You think the rules don't apply to the golden boy?

648
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,920
才华确实能掩盖不少问题
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

649
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,320
这世上懂你的人不多
Don't alienate the only people in the world

650
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,300
别疏远他们
that understand what you do.

651
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,440
没准哪天你会需要他们
One day you might need them.

652
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,960
FAECT
F-a-e-c-t!

653
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,350
建筑师  工程师  化学家与技师联盟
Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians.

654
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,250
洛马尼茨  他们一个月付你多少钱
Lomanitz, what do you get paid a month?

655
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,470
重点不是这个  劳伦斯
That's not the point, Lawrence.

656
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,710
你们跟农民和码头工人
What do any of you have in common

657
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,360
有什么共同点吗
with farm laborers and dock workers?

658
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,250
有很多
Plenty.

659
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:27,220
都出去  快
Everybody out. Now!

660
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,480
你留下
Not you.

661
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,860
你在干什么
What are you doing?

662
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,930
工会而已
It's a trade union.

663
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,770
满是共党的工会
Filled with communists.

664
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,560
那又怎样  我又没入党
So? I haven't joined the party.

665
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,360
正是因为这破事
They won't let me bring you onto the project

666
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,720
他们不让我带你参加那个项目
because of this shit.

667
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,200
连项目是干什么的都不让我告诉你
They won't even let me tell you what the project is.

668
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,490
我知道是什么项目
Oh, I know what the project is.

669
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:54,430
是吗
Oh, really?

670
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,020
我们都听说了
We've all heard

671
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,160
爱因斯坦和西拉德给罗斯福写信
about Einstein and Szilard's letter to Roosevelt

672
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,630
提醒他德国人可能造出炸弹
warning him the Germans could make a bomb,

673
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,140
我清楚纳粹有了炸弹就意味着什么
and I know what it means for the Nazis to have a bomb.

674
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,140
难道我不清楚吗
And I don't?

675
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,950
被他们赶进集中营的  不是你的同胞
It's not your people they're herding into camps.

676
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,450
是我的
It's mine.

677
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,180
你以为是我告诉了他们你的政治立场吗
You think that I tell them about your politics?

678
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,960
下次你从集会回家的时候
The next time you're coming home from a meeting,

679
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,190
从后视镜里看一眼
why don't you take a look in the rearview mirror,

680
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,140
注意电话听筒的杂音
listen to the sounds on your phone line,

681
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,340
别再这么天真了好吗
and stop being so goddamn naive?

682
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,870
他们为什么会关心我做什么
Why would they care what I do?

683
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,900
因为你不只是自命不凡
Because you're not just self-important,

684
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,090
你是真的很重要
you're actually important.

685
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,220
好吧
Okay.

686
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,670
我明白了
I get it.

687
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,850
你要是能再...
If you could just be a little more...

688
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,670
务实一点  我会和洛马尼茨他们谈谈的
Pragmatic. I'll talk to Lomanitz, I'll talk to the others.

689
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,300
不用担心  我能解决好
You don't have to worry, it's done.

690
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,640
劳伦斯
Lawrence.

691
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,220
那欢迎加入战争
Then welcome to the war.

692
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,270
我填写了第一份安全调查表
I filled out my first security questionnaire

693
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,710
并被告知  我与左翼团体的联系
and was informed that my involvement with left-wing groups

694
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:00,620
不会妨碍我为核项目工作
would not prove a bar to my working on the atomic program.

695
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,360
为什么他与共产党人的关系
Why were his communist associations

696
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,330
在战争期间没被视为安全风险
not seen as a security risk during the war?

697
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,280
参议员先生  我不可能
Senator, I can't possibly answer for security clearance

698
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,440
为在我认识此人几年前就获批的安全许可负责
granted years before I ever met the man.

699
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,020
好吧  那之后呢
Fine. What about after?

700
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,580
战后
After the war,

701
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,600
奥本海默博士
Dr. Oppenheimer

702
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,390
是世上最受敬重的科学家
was the most respected scientific voice in the world.

703
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,480
因此我才请他来执掌高等研究院
That's why I asked him to run the Institute.

704
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,580
因此他为原子能委员会出谋划策
That's why he advised the Atomic Energy Commission.

705
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,700
就这么简单
Simple as that.

706
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,780
他们指控我什么
What are they accusing me of?

707
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,290
我觉得他们只是想知道
I think they just want to know

708
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,850
1947到1954年间
what happened between 1947 and 1954

709
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,400
是什么让你改变了对奥本海默安全许可的决定
to change your mind on Oppenheimer's security clearance.

710
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,470
不是我
I didn't.

711
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:38,740
我是原子能委员会的主席
I was chair of the AEC, but it wasn't me

712
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,790
-但对罗伯特的指控不是我提的  -那是谁
- that brought the charges against Robert. - Who did?

713
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,350
某个国会原子能联合委员会的前成员
Some former staff member of the Joint Congressional Committee.

714
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,140
他叫波登  是个激进的反共分子
He was a rabid anti-communist named Borden.

715
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,840
他写信给联调局  要求他们采取行动
He wrote to the FBI demanding they take action.

716
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,360
联调局  为什么不直接找原子能委员会
The FBI? Why not go to the AEC direct?

717
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,650
太过直接  大家就会知道你是主使
You'd get caught holding the knife yourself.

718
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,010
波登为什么和奥本海默过不去
What did Borden have against Oppenheimer?

719
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,470
这是麦卡锡时代
This is the McCarthy era.

720
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,610
跟赤色沾一点边就会失业
People hounded out of jobs for any hint of red, and...

721
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,820
从奥本海默的安全档案可知
Reading Oppenheimer's security file,

722
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,360
他的共产党弟弟
his communist brother,

723
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,320
弟媳  未婚妻  好友  妻子
sister-in-law, fiancée, best friend, wife.

724
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,860
更不用说薛瓦利埃事件了
That's before we even get to the Chevalier incident.

725
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,940
但波登是怎么拿到奥本海默的安全档案的
But how would Borden have access to Oppenheimer's security file?

726
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,880
有人给他的
Because somebody gave it to him.

727
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,670
某个想让罗伯特闭嘴的人
Somebody who wanted Robert silenced.

728
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,800
-谁  -谁知道呢
- Who? - Who knows?

729
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,260
罗伯特没照顾到
Robert didn't take care

730
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,020
华盛顿那些政治掮客的想法
not to upset the power brokers in Washington.

731
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,320
他对原子能的看法坚定不移
His opinions on the atom became definitive,

732
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,130
对我们这些凡人也不常有耐心
and he wasn't always patient with us mere mortals.

733
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,950
我就遭受过不少苛刻的对待
I came in for plenty of harsh treatment.

734
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:43,440
之前有次原子能委员会
There was an AEC vote

735
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,830
投票表决同位素到挪威的出口
on the export of isotopes to Norway,

736
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,590
他们拉上罗伯特  让我出尽洋相
and they drafted in Robert to make me look like a fool.

737
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,920
不过奥本海默博士
But Dr. Oppenheimer,

738
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,810
我们已听施特劳斯上将说
we've already heard from Admiral Strauss

739
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,120
我们的敌人可能会利用这些同位素
that these isotopes could be useful to our enemies

740
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,510
制造核武器
in the production of atomic weapons.

741
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,930
议员先生  造核武器还可能用到铲子呢
Congressman, you could use a shovel in making atomic weapons.

742
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,990
的确会用到
In fact, you do.

743
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,970
造核武器还可能用到一瓶啤酒
You could use a bottle of beer in making atomic weapons.

744
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,920
的确会用到
In fact, you do.

745
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,770
要我说同位素还没有电子元件有用
I'd say isotopes are less useful than electronic components,

746
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,720
但比三明治有用
but more useful than a sandwich.

747
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,590
天才不一定有智慧
Genius is no guarantee of wisdom.

748
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,180
这人为何洞悉一切却又如此盲目
How could this man who saw so much be so blind?

749
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,620
吉蒂
Kitty?

750
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,650
吉蒂
Kitty?

751
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,170
吉蒂
Kitty.

752
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,720
那个项目
The project.

753
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,520
我加入了
I'm in.

754
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,170
-我加入了  -来庆祝吧
- I'm in! - Let's celebrate.

755
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,370
你不该去哄哄他吗
Shouldn't you go to him?

756
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,600
我他妈哄了他一天了
I have been going to him all fucking day.

757
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,120
我不知道该如何开口
I don't know how to say this.

758
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,890
我羞于启齿
I'm ashamed to ask.

759
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,070
说吧
Anything.

760
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,140
-拜托照顾彼得  -没问题
- Take Peter. - Sure.

761
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,400
不  是照顾一阵子  哈康
No, for a while, Haak.

762
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,800
一阵子
A while.

763
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,460
-吉蒂知道你来这里了吗  -她当然知道
- Does Kitty know you're here? - Yes, of course she knows.

764
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,600
她当然知道
Of course she knows.

765
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,180
我们太差劲了  自私  差劲
We're awful people. Selfish, awful people.

766
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,480
算了当我没问
Forget I asked.

767
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,570
自私  差劲的人
Selfish, awful people,

768
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,500
是意识不到他们的自私和差劲的
they don't know they're selfish and awful.

769
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,450
坐吧
Sit, sit, sit.

770
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,830
罗伯特  你能看到现实世界以外的另一个世界
Robert, you see beyond the world we live in.

771
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,470
是要付出代价的
There is a price to be paid for that.

772
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,230
我们当然会帮你
Of course we'll help you.

773
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,270
一切都在改变  罗伯特
Everything's changing, Robert.

774
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,610
有了孩子自然会改变...
Having a child was always going to change...

775
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:31,340
不  世界在转向新的方向
No, the world is pivoting in some new direction.

776
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,590
在改革
Reforming.

777
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,380
这是你的机会
This is your moment.

778
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,510
我们在召集人马  研究...
We're putting together a group to study...

779
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,170
不是"我们"
We shouldn't be doing anything.

780
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,190
是"你"
You should.

781
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,880
劳伦斯搞不定的
Lawrence won't get this done.

782
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,420
托尔曼和拉比也不能  你可以
Or Tolman or Rabi. You will.

783
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,020
那些穿军装的是什么人
Who are the uniforms?

784
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,500
我还以为你知道呢
I thought you might know.

785
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,990
奥本海默博士
Dr. Oppenheimer.

786
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,790
我是格罗夫斯上校  这位是尼科斯中校
I'm Colonel Groves. This is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.

787
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,220
送去干洗
Have that dry cleaned.

788
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,210
如果你这么对待一位中校的话
Well, if that's how you treat a lieutenant colonel,

789
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,870
我不敢想你会怎样对一名小小的物理学家
I'd hate to see how you treat a... humble physicist.

790
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,810
等我以后遇到了你就知道了
If I ever meet one, I'll let you know.

791
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,180
全世界都在打仗
Theaters of combat all over the world,

792
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,070
我却只能留在华盛顿
but I have to stay in Washington.

793
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,740
-为什么  -我建了五角大楼
- Why? - I built the Pentagon.

794
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,930
要员们很喜欢
The brass likes it so much,

795
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,400
于是又让我掌管曼哈顿工程区
they made me take over the Manhattan Engineer District.

796
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,990
-那是什么  -别装了
- Which is? - Don't be a smartass.

797
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,070
你清楚得很
You know damn well what it is.

798
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,590
你和全国物理系半数教职员工都清楚
You and half of every physics department across the country.

799
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,360
这是首要问题
That's problem number one.

800
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,730
我还以为搞到足够多的铀矿石
I thought problem number one

801
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,980
才是首要问题
would be securing enough uranium ore.

802
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,550
-一千两百吨  我上任那天就买下了  -那加工呢
- 1,200 tons, bought the day I took charge. - Processing?

803
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,640
刚在田纳西州的橡树岭动工
Just broke ground at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

804
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:58,910
现在我在物色项目负责人
Now I'm looking for a project director.

805
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,860
想到我了
And my name came up?

806
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,910
不是
Nope.

807
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,200
虽然你把量子物理学带到了美国
Even though you brought quantum physics to America,

808
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,620
让我还挺好奇的
which made me curious.

809
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:08,410
你调查出什么了
What have you found out?

810
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:13,380
你是个半吊子  花花公子  疑似共产党
You're a dilettante, a womanizer, a suspected communist.

811
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,730
我是支持新政的民主党
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

812
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,140
我说了是"疑似"
I said "suspected".

813
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,560
情绪多变  做作  高傲  神经质
Unstable, theatrical, egotistical, neurotic.

814
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,650
没找到优点  是吧
Nothing good, no?

815
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,590
甚至没句  "他很聪明  但是"
Not even "he's brilliant, but..."

816
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,550
聪明是你们这个圈子最基本的品质  所以没有
Well, brilliance is taken for granted in your circle, so no.

817
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,730
唯一一个夸了你的是
No, the only person who had anything good to say

818
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,140
理查德·托尔曼
was Richard Tolman.

819
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,660
托尔曼觉得你为人正直
Tolman thinks you have integrity,

820
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,860
但我还是觉得
but he also strikes me as a guy

821
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,520
他看人的本事不如科研
who knows more about science than people.

822
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,730
但你还是来了
Yet here you are.

823
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,360
你不太信任人
You don't take much on trust.

824
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,200
我什么都不信任
I don't take anything on trust.

825
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,660
你怎么没得诺贝尔奖
Why don't you have a Nobel Prize?

826
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,630
你怎么没当上将军
Why aren't you a general?

827
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,880
这事要是成了就当上了
They're making me one for this.

828
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,350
说不定我也一样
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

829
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,850
造炸弹能得诺贝尔奖
The Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

830
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,990
阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔发明了硝酸甘油炸药
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

831
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,180
你打算怎么做
So how would you proceed?

832
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:02,630
你说的是
You're talking about

833
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,620
抢在纳粹之前
turning theory into a practical weapon system

834
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,130
把理论变成可用的武器
faster than the Nazis.

835
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,910
他们已经比我们提前了12个月
Who have a 12-month head start.

836
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,200
-是18个月  -你怎么知道
- 18. - How could you possibly know that?

837
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,430
我们的快中子研究花了六个月
Our fast neutron research took six months.

838
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,880
纳粹指派的研究负责人
The man they've undoubtedly put in charge

839
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,420
肯定不会卡在这上面
will have made that leap instantly.

840
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,790
你觉得他们派谁负责了
Who do you think they put in charge?

841
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:19,870
维尔纳·海森堡
Werner Heisenberg.

842
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,890
他是我见过对原子结构
He has the most intuitive understanding of atomic structure

843
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,080
有着最直观认识的人
I have ever seen.

844
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,750
-你了解他的研究吗  -我了解他这个人
- You know his work? - I know him,

845
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,200
就像我了解瓦尔特·博特  冯·魏茨泽克  迪布纳
just like I know Walther Bothe, von Weizsäcker, Diebner.

846
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,190
硬碰硬比速度的话  德国人必胜
In a straight race, the Germans win.

847
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,580
-我们有一线希望  -是什么
- We've got one hope. - Which is?

848
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,070
反犹太主义
Antisemitism.

849
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,650
什么
What?

850
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,490
希特勒说量子物理学是"犹太人的科学"
Hitler called quantum physics "Jewish science".

851
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,920
跟爱因斯坦当面说的
Said it right to Einstein's face.

852
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,450
我们唯一的希望就是希特勒被仇恨蒙蔽
Our one hope is that Hitler is so blinded by hate

853
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,510
拒绝给海森堡提供足够的资源
that he's denied Heisenberg proper resources,

854
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,420
因为那将耗费海量资源
because it'll take vast resources.

855
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,050
而我国最优秀的科学家齐心协力
Our nation's best scientists working together.

856
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,220
但现在  大家散落在各地
Right now, they're scattered.

857
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,220
正好做到了权限分隔
Which gives us compartmentalization.

858
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:57,220
只有让所有人都清楚情况  才能高效工作
All minds have to see the whole task to contribute efficiently.

859
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,450
安全保密问题可能会让我们落后
Poor security may cost us the race.

860
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,960
但低效一定会
Inefficiency will.

861
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,450
反正德国人比我们知道得更多
The Germans know more than us anyway.

862
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,820
苏联人可不一定
The Russians don't.

863
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,600
慢着  我们在和谁打仗
Remind me, who are we at war with?

864
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,880
鉴于你的过去
Somebody with your past

865
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,590
你肯定不想让人觉得你忽视了保密工作
doesn't want to be seen downplaying the importance of security

866
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,500
没提防我们的共产党盟友
from our communist allies.

867
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,550
有道理  但是  不
Point taken, but... no.

868
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,260
你不能跟我说不
You don't get to say no to me.

869
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,500
我的职责就是在你搞错时跟你说不
It's my job to say no to you when you're wrong.

870
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,810
所以你接下这份工作了
So you have the job now?

871
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,480
我再想想
I'm considering it.

872
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,890
我明白你的名声从何而来了
I'm starting to see where you got your reputation.

873
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,790
我最喜欢的回应是
My favorite response:

874
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:39,030
"奥本海默连汉堡摊都管不好"
"Oppenheimer couldn't run a hamburger stand."

875
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,620
我是不行
I couldn't.

876
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,060
但我能管好曼哈顿计划
But I can run the Manhattan Project.

877
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,930
有一个办法保持平衡
There's a way to balance these things.

878
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,960
让劳伦斯继续管理伯克利这里的放射性实验室
Keep the Rad Lab here at Berkeley, under Lawrence.

879
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,410
西拉德管理芝加哥大学的冶金实验室
Met Lab in Chicago, under Szilard.

880
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,760
大规模精炼  你说在哪来着  田纳西州
Large-scale refining, where did you say, Tennessee?

881
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:59,400
-还有汉福德  -还有汉福德
- And Hanford. - And Hanford.

882
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,130
全美工业相关的科技创新
All America's industrial-minded scientific innovation,

883
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,700
都由铁路连接贯通  朝着一个目标
connected by rail, focused on one goal,

884
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,330
在时间和空间上都汇于一点
one point in space and time.

885
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,080
汇于这里  一个秘密实验室
And it comes together here, a secret laboratory.

886
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,450
在荒无人烟的地方  安全  自给自足
In the middle of nowhere, secure, self-sufficient.

887
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,900
设备  住房  施工
Equipment, housing, the works.

888
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,520
封闭式作业
Keep everyone there until it's done.

889
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,240
-我们需要学校  商店  教堂  -为什么
- We'll need a school, stores, a church. - Why?

890
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,940
如果不允许科学家带家属
If we don't let scientists bring their families,

891
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,350
那他们就没法全情投入
we'll never get the best.

892
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,150
你想要密不透风  就建座镇吧  要快
You want security, build a town. Build it fast.

893
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,070
在哪儿
Where?

894
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,860
欢迎来到洛斯阿拉莫斯
Welcome to Los Alamos.

895
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,540
那边有所男校  我们得征用它
There's a boys' school we'll have to commandeer,

896
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,410
本地的印第安人会来办葬礼
and the local Indians come up here for burial rites,

897
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,250
除此之外  荒无人烟
but apart from that, nothing.

898
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,010
方圆65千米皆是如此
40 miles. Any direction.

899
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,610
这就是我们的最佳地点
We'll have to find the perfect spot.

900
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,270
-为了什么  -为了成功
- For? - Success.

901
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,780
给他建个镇子  要快
Build him a town. Fast.

902
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,010
我们去招募科学家吧
Let's go recruit some scientists.

903
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,260
我为什么要抛家弃子
Why would I leave my family?

904
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,070
我说了  可以把家人带上
I told you, you can bring your family.

905
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:02,640
-我不是军人  奥比  -军人
- I'm not a soldier, Oppie. - A soldier?

906
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,310
他是将军  除了他我不需要其他军人了
He's a general. I've got all the soldier I need.

907
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,010
我能说到什么程度
What can I tell them?

908
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,550
海森堡  迪布纳  博特  玻尔
Heisenberg, Diebner, Bothe and Bohr.

909
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:10,960
这些人有什么共通之处
What do these men have in common?

910
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,920
-都是原子理论最杰出的科学家  -还有呢
- Uh, the greatest minds on atomic theory. - Yes, and?

911
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,090
你看着办吧
As much as you like.

912
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,370
说太多我自然会踹你的蛋
Until you feel my boot on your balls.

913
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,610
你懂同位素  你懂爆炸
You know isotopes, and you know explosives

914
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,170
你们是全球最顶尖的专家
better than anyone in the world.

915
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,850
但你不说你要干什么
But you can't tell us what you're doing.

916
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,360
-我不知道  -他们在纳粹那里
- I don't know. - The Nazis have them.

917
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:32,870
尼尔斯·玻尔在哥本哈根
Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.

918
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,110
那也是纳粹的占领区
Under Nazi occupation.

919
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,200
普林斯顿不印报纸了吗
Did they stop printing newspapers in Princeton?

920
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,340
我们为什么要跑到个不毛之地
Why would we go to the middle of nowhere

921
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:39,780
还不知道要待多久
for who knows how long?

922
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,780
一两年吧  或者三年
For a year or two. Or three.

923
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,160
将军  能让我们单独聊聊吗
General, could you... give us a moment?

924
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:50,280
是要释放一种巨大的力量
It's about unleashing a strong force.

925
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,130
要赶在纳粹前面
Before the Nazis do.

926
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,890
天啊
Oh my god.

927
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,360
尼尔斯才不会为纳粹卖命
Niels won't work for the Nazis.

928
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,550
当然不会
No, never.

929
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,740
但他在纳粹地盘上  不在我们这
But while they have him, we don't.

930
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,930
所以我需要你
That's why I need you.

931
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,940
你凭什么觉得我会同意
Why would you think I'd do that?

932
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,580
凭什么  凭什么
Why? Why?

933
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,280
就凭这是史无前例的
How about because this is the most important fucking thing

934
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,270
重要事件
to ever happen in the history of the world?

935
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:10,440
够不够
How about that?

936
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,210
妈的
Fuck.

937
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,510
他们不会同意我参与的
They're not gonna let me onto this project.

938
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,280
哪怕战争结束了
And failing a security check

939
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,910
没通过安全审查也会影响我的职业
is not going to be good for a career even after the war.

940
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,490
所以你只能跟我们共事一段时间  那又如何
So you're a fellow traveler. So what?

941
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,370
现在国家进入紧急状态
This is a national emergency.

942
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,130
关于我也有些传言  但他们让我总负责
I've got some skeletons. They put me in charge.

943
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:32,300
他们需要我们
They need us.

944
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:33,840
总有一天就不需要了
Until they don't.

945
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:40,310
有可能把玻尔从丹麦带出来吗
Is there any chance of getting Bohr out of Denmark?

946
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,200
没门儿  我和英国那边联系过了
Yeah, no dice. I checked with the British.

947
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,790
除非盟军打回欧洲大陆
Until we get Allied boots back onto the continent,

948
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,020
不然没可能
there's just no way.

949
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,910
他就那么重要吗
Is he that important?

950
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,330
有几个人能证明爱因斯坦错了
How many people do you know who proved Einstein wrong?

951
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,440
飞机不是要快很多吗
You know, it really would be quicker to take a plane.

952
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,100
乘飞机太冒险了
A plane's too risky.

953
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,450
国家需要我们
The country needs us.

954
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,970
怎么了  伙计们
What happened, guys?

955
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,360
他们说那房子装不下粒子回旋加速器
They say the building's too small for this cyclotron.

956
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,440
让他们和建筑师开个会
Get them together with the architects.

957
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,810
这儿什么时候开始运行
When's this place supposed to open?

958
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,730
两个月后
Two months.

959
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,460
罗伯特  你是个即兴创作家  但...
Robert, you're the great improviser, but this...

960
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,920
你不能只想当然
you can't do in your head.

961
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,370
四个部门
Four divisions.

962
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,290
实验部  理论部  冶炼部
Experimental, theoretical, metallurgical.

963
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:35,570
谁负责理论部
Who's running theoretical?

964
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,510
我
I am.

965
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,780
这正是我担心的  你要管的太多了
That's what I was afraid of. You're spread too thin.

966
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,450
那你负责理论部
So you take theoretical.

967
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:48,240
我不准备来  罗伯特
I'm not coming here, Robert.

968
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,120
为什么
Why not?

969
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,690
炸弹爆炸  正义之人邪恶之人都将丧命
You drop a bomb and it falls on the just and the unjust.

970
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:09,730
我不希望三个世纪的物理学巅峰之作
I don't wish the culmination of three centuries of physics

971
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,580
是一件大规模杀伤性武器
to be a weapon of mass destruction.

972
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,340
伊西
Izzy...

973
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:27,970
我不知道我们是否有资格掌控这种武器
I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon.

974
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:32,450
但我知道纳粹一定不可以
But I know the Nazis can't.

975
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,650
我们别无选择
We have no choice.

976
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,190
那...
Then...

977
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,490
你要做的第二件事
the second thing you have to do

978
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:47,830
是让汉斯·贝特负责理论部
is appoint Hans Bethe to run the theoretical division.

979
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,120
等等  那第一件事是什么
Wait, what was the first?

980
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,420
脱了这身可笑的军服
Take off that ridiculous uniform.

981
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,850
你是科学家
You're a scientist.

982
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,660
格罗夫斯坚持让我们穿
Groves is insisting we join.

983
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,940
让格罗夫斯吃屎去吧
Tell Groves to go shit in his hat.

984
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,570
他们需要的是科学家
They need us for who we are.

985
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:02,850
所以做你自己就行
So be yourself.

986
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,590
还要更好
Only better.

987
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,090
这是唯一一把钥匙
This is the only key.

988
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,690
泰勒已经来了
And Teller's already here.

989
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,750
要我带他进来吗
Shall I just show him in?

990
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,570
不  等其他人都到了
No, let's wait for the others.

991
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,540
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

992
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,610
-你好  爱德华  -好
- Hello, Edward. - Yes.

993
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,880
先生们  洛斯阿拉莫斯的T区完工前
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

994
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,020
我们先在这里工作
until the T Section at Los Alamos is finished.

995
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,180
爱德华  能让我...
Edward, can I...?

996
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,330
这更重要
This is more important.

997
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,380
我计算链式反应时
When I calculated the chain reaction,

998
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,510
发现一种很令人不安的可能性
I found a rather troubling possibility.

999
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,180
这不可能
No, this can't be right.

1000
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,660
告诉我你是怎么算的
Show me how you did your calculations.

1001
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,570
好
Yes.

1002
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,030
-指数级的  -不  不
- Exponential. - No, no, no. No.

1003
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,300
这不可能是真的
This is fantasy.

1004
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,690
泰勒的计算不可能是对的
Teller's calculations can't be right.

1005
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,520
我去趟普林斯顿  你也自己算一遍
Do them yourself while I go to Princeton.

1006
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,640
-去做什么  -去找爱因斯坦
- What for? - To talk to Einstein.

1007
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,960
但你俩对很多事情都有分歧
Well, there's not much common ground between you two.

1008
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,490
所以我要看看他的观点
That's why I should get his view.

1009
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,600
阿尔伯特
Albert.

1010
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,930
奥本海默博士
Ah, Dr. Oppenheimer.

1011
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,960
你认识哥德尔博士吗
Have you met Dr. Gödel?

1012
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,690
我们经常在这儿散步
We walk here most days.

1013
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:05,000
树木的结构最具启发性了
Trees have the most inspiring structures.

1014
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:07,340
阿尔伯特  能和你单独聊聊吗
Albert, might I have a word?

1015
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,610
当然  失陪一下  库尔特
Of course. Excuse me, Kurt.

1016
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,230
库尔特曾绝食过一段日子
Some days Kurt refuses to eat.

1017
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,560
即使在普林斯顿
Even in Princeton,

1018
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,030
他还觉得纳粹会给他下毒
he's convinced that the Nazis can poison his food.

1019
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:33,030
这...  这是谁算的
Whose, whose work is this?

1020
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,060
泰勒
Teller's.

1021
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,260
你怎么看
What do you take it to mean?

1022
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,740
中子撞进原子核
Neutrons smash into the nucleus,

1023
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,400
释放出的中子又撞进其他原子核
releasing neutrons to smash into other nuclei.

1024
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,090
到达临界点
Criticality.

1025
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,650
不可逆转  巨大的爆炸力
Point of no return. Massive explosive force.

1026
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,320
但这一次  链式反应没有停止
But this time, the chain reaction doesn't stop.

1027
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,450
这将点燃大气层
It would ignite the atmosphere.

1028
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,010
引爆核装置
When we detonate an atomic device,

1029
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,260
可能引发的链式反应  将...
we might start a chain reaction that...

1030
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,780
毁灭世界
destroys the world.

1031
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,470
所以你来找我
So here we are, hmm?

1032
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:08,950
你在概率的量子世界中迷失了
Lost in your quantum world of probabilities,

1033
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,940
需要确定性
and needing certainty.

1034
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,600
你能亲自算一遍吗
Can you run the calculations yourself?

1035
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,760
你我唯一的共同点
About the only thing you and I have in common

1036
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,990
就是蔑视数学
is a disdain for mathematics.

1037
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:21,090
伯克利谁在算这个
Who's working on this in Berkeley?

1038
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,270
汉斯·贝特
Hans Bethe.

1039
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,500
他会找出答案的
Well, he'll get to the truth.

1040
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,400
如果答案是灾难呢
And if the truth is catastrophic?

1041
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:33,450
那你就停手  并且将发现告诉纳粹
Then you stop, and you share your findings with the Nazis.

1042
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,690
这样两边都不会毁灭世界
So neither side destroys the world.

1043
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,060
罗伯特
Robert.

1044
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:45,090
这是你的  不是我的
This is yours, not mine.

1045
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,870
泰勒错了
Teller's wrong.

1046
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,450
他错了
He's wrong.

1047
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:13,880
知道了泰勒的关键性假设
When you know Teller's critical assumptions,

1048
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,270
真相就显现了
the real picture emerges.

1049
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,330
结论呢
Bottom line?

1050
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,190
核反应失控的几率
The chances of an out-of-control nuclear reaction

1051
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:20,270
几近于零
are near-zero.

1052
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,660
"几近"于零
Near-zero.

1053
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,660
奥比  这可是好消息啊
Oppie, this is good news.

1054
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:27,900
能再算一遍吗
Can you run them again?

1055
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,360
可答案是一样的
Oh, you'll get the same answer.

1056
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,380
真正引爆之前
Until they actually detonate one of these things,

1057
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,330
最大的确定性就是这个
the best assurance you're going to get is this.

1058
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,090
几近于零
Near-zero.

1059
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,610
理论是有局限的
Theory will take you only so far.

1060
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,860
-好啊  -好
- Hello! - Hi.

1061
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,170
我们好想他
We missed him.

1062
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,380
要领养吗
You want to adopt?

1063
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,550
她开玩笑的
She's kidding.

1064
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,490
离开前我们想见见你们
We wanted to see you before we left.

1065
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,690
要去一个神秘的地方了
For parts unknown.

1066
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,510
知道前几天我碰见谁了吗
You know who I ran into the other day?

1067
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,990
埃尔滕顿
Eltenton.

1068
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,220
壳牌的化学家吗  工会那个人
That chemist from Shell? The union guy?

1069
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,920
没错  FAECT那个人
Yeah, the FAECT guy.

1070
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,400
他一直在抱怨  我们这仗打得不对劲
He was moaning about how we're handling the war.

1071
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,350
怎么说
How so?

1072
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,620
缺少和盟友们的合作
Lack of cooperation with our allies.

1073
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,160
据说我们的政府
Apparently, our government's not sharing

1074
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,030
没有和苏联人分享任何研究信息
any research with the Russians.

1075
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:20,330
他说大部分科学家都觉得这项政策是愚蠢的
He said most scientists think the policy is stupid.

1076
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,470
-是吗  -是的
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

1077
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,960
他说如果有人想要绕过官方渠道
He mentioned that if anyone had anything they wanted to pass on,

1078
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,510
传递什么信息  他可以帮忙
going around official channels, that he could help.

1079
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:44,350
那是叛国
That would be treason.

1080
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,870
当然
Yes, of course.

1081
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,420
我只是觉得应该告诉你
I just thought you should know.

1082
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,590
孩子睡下了
The brat is down.

1083
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,390
马提尼酒呢
Where are the martinis?

1084
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,780
马上来
Coming right up.

1085
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,060
我们的谈话到此为止
The conversation ended there.

1086
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:07,170
我们是老朋友了  我从没觉得
Nothing in our long-standing friendship would have led me to believe

1087
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:10,200
薛瓦利埃是在套话
that Chevalier was actually seeking information,

1088
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:13,170
而且我非常肯定  他对我当时的工作
and I am certain that he had no idea of the work

1089
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:14,700
毫不知情
in which I was engaged.

1090
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,310
长期以来我都知道
It has long been clear to me that

1091
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:24,060
我当时应该立即上报这件事
I should have reported this incident at once.

1092
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:27,140
奥本海默事件
The Oppheimer situation highlights the tension

1093
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,510
凸显了科学家和国家安全机构之间的紧张关系
between scientists and the security apparatus.

1094
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,900
为了了解候选人在原子能委员会任职期间
In hopes of learning how the nominee handled such issues

1095
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,950
是如何处理此类问题的
during his time at the AEC,

1096
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:37,910
我们会请一位科学家出席
we'll have a scientist appearing before the committee.

1097
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,160
他们请的谁
Who are they bringing in?

1098
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,350
还没有说
They hadn't said.

1099
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,590
主席先生  我提名的是商务部长
Mr. Chairman, if I may, I'm nominated for Commerce Secretary.

1100
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,940
为什么需要听取科学家的意见
Why seek the opinion of scientists?

1101
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:50,050
事关内阁职位  上将
This is a cabinet post, Admiral.

1102
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,970
我们需要广听各方面的声音
We seek a wide range of opinion.

1103
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:55,210
我想知道这位作证的科学家是谁
I'd like to know the name of the scientist testifying.

1104
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,000
希望有交叉询问的机会
I'd like the chance to cross-examine.

1105
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,620
这里不是法庭
This is not a court.

1106
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,270
这算哪门子走形式
Formality, huh?

1107
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:05,580
自1925年以来还没有总统提名的内阁候选人落选
No presidential cabinet nominee has failed to be confirmed since 1925.

1108
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,340
这只是游戏规则而已
This is just how the game is played.

1109
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,870
职位肯定是你的了  路易斯  友好点
It's in the bag, Lewis. So play nice.

1110
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,920
他们找来一个科学家  又能怎样
They bring in a scientist, so what?

1111
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,370
我比你更了解科学家  顾问先生
You don't know scientists like I do, Counselor.

1112
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,590
他们厌恶任何质疑他们判断的人
They resent anyone who questions their judgment,

1113
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,340
你不是科学家的话更甚
especially if you're not one of them.

1114
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,840
我做过原子能委员会主席
I was chair of the AEC.

1115
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,040
罗伯特的遭遇  我是最好的出气筒
I'm easy to blame for what happened to Robert.

1116
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,370
我们不能让参议院认为
We can't have the Senate thinking

1117
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:25,770
您不受科学家们支持  先生
the scientific community doesn't support you, sir.

1118
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:28,500
或者我们转换策略
Or should we pivot?

1119
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,180
-什么样的策略  -欣然接受
- To what? - And embrace it.

1120
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,440
"我与奥本海默开战  美国赢得胜利"
"I fought Oppenheimer, and the US won."

1121
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,100
我认为不必走到那一步
I don't think we need to go there.

1122
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,420
我们能不能找到一个了解内情的人
Isn't there someone we can call who knows what really happened?

1123
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,070
-泰勒  -他会给他们留下好印象的
- Teller. - He'll make an impression.

1124
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:41,060
能不能打听到出席科学家的身份
Can you get the name of the scientist they've called?

1125
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,680
-也许吧  -挖出战时他身在芝加哥
- Probably. - Find out if he was based in Chicago

1126
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,130
还是洛斯阿拉莫斯
or Los Alamos during the war.

1127
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:46,140
这有什么关系
Why does that matter?

1128
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,340
因为如果他在芝加哥
Well, if he was based in Chicago,

1129
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,860
一定是在西拉德和费米手下工作
they worked under Szilard and Fermi,

1130
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,020
而不是在洛斯阿拉莫斯跟奥比一条心
not the cult to Oppie in Los Alamos.

1131
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,570
那个地方是罗伯特一手建立的
Robert built that damn place.

1132
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:54,610
创始人  市长  警长都是他
He was founder, mayor, sheriff.

1133
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,670
三位一体
All rolled into one.

1134
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,190
再有一个酒馆就万事俱备了
Now all it needs is a saloon.

1135
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:41,820
这里没有厨房
There's no kitchen.

1136
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,460
真的吗  我会想办法的
Really? We'll fix that.

1137
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:54,950
铁丝网  枪炮
Barbed wire? Guns?

1138
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,230
-奥比  -我们在打仗呢  汉斯
- Oppie... - We're at war, Hans.

1139
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,070
哈利法克斯
Halifax.

1140
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:03,580
1917年
1917.

1141
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,530
一艘满载弹药的货船在港口爆炸
A cargo ship carrying munitions explodes in the harbor.

1142
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:11,720
一次巨大且突然的化学反应
A vast and sudden chemical reaction.

1143
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,400
史上最大的人为爆炸
The biggest man-made explosion in history.

1144
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:21,680
现在来算一算  如果换成核反应
Now, let's calculate how much more destructive it would have been

1145
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,990
破坏力比化学反应大多少
if it were a nuclear and not a chemical reaction,

1146
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,200
用吨TNT当量表示
expressing power in terms of tons of TNT.

1147
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,070
但会有几千几万吨TNT当量
But it will be thousands.

1148
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,380
那就换成千吨TNT当量
Well, then, kilotons.

1149
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,720
如果用铀-235
Using U-235,

1150
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,990
炸弹需要...
the bomb will need a...

1151
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,140
抱歉  装置需要一个15千克的球体
Sorry. Gadget will need a 33-pound sphere

1152
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,570
大约这么大
about this size,

1153
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:51,190
如果用钚  需要一个4.5千克的球体
or using plutonium, a ten-pound sphere.

1154
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,900
橡树岭上个月精炼出的铀一共有这么多
Here's the amount of uranium Oak Ridge refined all of last month.

1155
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,750
汉福德生产的钚有这么多
And the Hanford plant made this much plutonium.

1156
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,990
浓缩够量以后  还需要引爆的方法
Now, if we can enrich these amounts, we need a way to detonate them.

1157
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,360
我们讲的让你无聊了吗  爱德华
Are we boring you, Edward?

1158
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:14,490
确实有一点
A little bit, yes.

1159
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:15,920
能问问为什么吗
May I ask why?

1160
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,450
我们来之前  早就知道裂变炸弹是可行的
We all entered this room knowing a fission bomb was possible.

1161
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,990
离开之前是不是应该创造点新东西
How about we leave it with something new?

1162
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,080
比如
Such as?

1163
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,120
不用铀和钚  改用氢
Instead of uranium or plutonium, we use hydrogen.

1164
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,950
重氢  氘
Heavy hydrogen. Deuterium.

1165
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:34,250
这样  我们用巨大的压力
You see, we compact the atoms together

1166
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,540
把原子压缩到一起  引发聚变反应
under great pressure to induce a fusion reaction.

1167
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,780
这样能量就不是千吨级  而是百万吨级
Then we'll get not kilotons, but megatons.

1168
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,990
等一下  等一下
Okay, hang on, hang on.

1169
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,600
那么如何产生足够的能量  让氢原子聚变呢
So how do you generate enough force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

1170
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:51,960
用一个小型裂变炸弹
A small fission bomb.

1171
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:53,790
还是嘛
There we are!

1172
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,770
既然无论如何都要用到裂变炸弹
Well, since we're going to need one anyway,

1173
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,360
能不能回到之前的讨论
can we get back to the business at hand?

1174
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:02,950
同位素出口问题并不是
The isotopes issue wasn't your most important

1175
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,910
你与奥本海默博士最大的政策分歧
policy disagreement with Dr. Oppenheimer.

1176
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,470
最大的分歧在于氢弹  对吗
It was the hydrogen bomb, wasn't it?

1177
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,400
我们是同事  对很多问题和而不同
As colleagues, we agreed to disagree on a great many things, uh...

1178
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,400
其中一个就是需不需要开始研究氢弹  是的
And one of them was the need for an H-bomb program, yes.

1179
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:33,550
通知得紧急  感谢各位前来
Thanks for convening on short notice.

1180
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,800
难以置信
I can't believe it.

1181
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,490
但事已至此  告诉我  我们目前都了解什么
But here we are. Catch me up. What do we know?

1182
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,760
一架B-29轰炸机在北太平洋检测到了辐射
One of our B-29s over the North Pacific has detected radiation.

1183
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,730
-拿到滤纸了吗  -都不用怀疑是什么情况
- Do we have the filter papers? - There's no doubt what this is.

1184
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,990
-白宫还在怀疑  -恐怕只是一厢情愿
- White House says there's a doubt. - Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

1185
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,880
那是远程探测滤纸吗
Are those the long-range detection filter papers?

1186
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,030
是原子弹试爆
It's an atomic test.

1187
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,980
苏联人造出了核弹
The Russians have a bomb.

1188
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,390
我们本应领先他们好几年  但是这...
We're supposed to be years ahead of them, but this...

1189
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,900
你们在洛斯阿拉莫斯是干什么吃的
What were you guys doing in Los Alamos?

1190
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,240
安保不是密不透风吗
Wasn't security tight?

1191
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,880
-当然是  您并不在那里  -抱歉  博士
- Of course it was. You weren't there. - Forgive me, Doctor.

1192
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,310
但我在场
But I was there.

1193
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,860
现在可以考虑具体的引爆机制了
We can now consider the actual mechanics of detonation.

1194
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,780
-有想法吗  -我把这种方法叫做射击
- Any ideas? - I call this shooting.

1195
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,480
把一小块可裂变物质打进大球内部
We fire a chunk of fissionable material into a larger sphere

1196
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,770
能量大到足以使之达到临界点
with enough force to achieve criticality.

1197
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,500
-大家觉得呢  -我想的是内爆
- What do we think? Anyone? - I've been thinking about implosion.

1198
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:33,960
球体周围包裹的炸药向内爆炸  压缩裂变物质
Explosives around the sphere blast inwards, crushing the material.

1199
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:37,590
-我想就此研究一下  -我去找军备处
- I'd like to investigate that idea. - I'll talk to ordnance.

1200
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,080
要来足够的炸药
Get you blowing things up.

1201
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,000
-进展如何  -我也很高兴见到你
- Progress? - Nice to see you too.

1202
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:44,450
这是我们的英国小分队
Meet the British contingent.

1203
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,580
奥本海默博士  我是克劳斯·福克斯
Dr. Oppenheimer. Klaus Fuchs.

1204
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:48,130
你做英国人多久了
How long have you been British?

1205
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,020
从希特勒说我不是德国人起就是了
Since Hitler told me I wasn't German.

1206
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:53,090
来吧  欢迎来到洛斯阿拉莫斯
Ah. Come, welcome to Los Alamos.

1207
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,070
学校已经建成运营
The school's up and running.

1208
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,480
-这是酒吧  -昼夜营业
- The bar. - Always running.

1209
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,550
我还找到了减少后勤员工的办法
And I thought of a way to reduce support staff.

1210
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,040
-那不是...  -希尔博夫人  没错
- Is that...? - Mrs. Serber, yes.

1211
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,260
我为所有参与人员的配偶安排了工作
I've offered jobs to all the wives,

1212
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,520
行政  图书馆  计算
admin, librarians, computation.

1213
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,670
既精简了人员  又维系了家庭
We cut down on staff, keep families together.

1214
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,620
-她们能胜任吗  -别胡说
- Are these women qualified? - Don't be absurd.

1215
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:13,770
她们拥有这里最聪明的头脑
These are some of the brightest minds in our community.

1216
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,500
而且已经获得了安全许可
And they're already security cleared.

1217
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:17,500
我已经告知格罗夫斯将军
I've informed General Groves you've been holding

1218
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,870
你每晚都办跨部门公开讨论
cross-divisional open discussions on a nightly basis.

1219
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,090
立刻停止
Shut them down.

1220
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,860
权限分隔至关重要
Compartmentalization is the key

1221
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:24,580
-这样才能保证安全...  -只有负责人参与
- to maintaining security... - Only the top men.

1222
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:26,640
不出意外他们也会与下属交流
Who presumably communicate with subordinates.

1223
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,740
这些人并不愚蠢  他们能够保持谨慎
These men aren't stupid. They can be discreet.

1224
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,550
我不喜欢
I don't like it.

1225
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,230
你对什么都是这样  这算什么准则
You don't like anything enough for that to be a fair test.

1226
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,550
每周一次  只有负责人参与
Once a week. Top men only.

1227
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,840
-我想让我弟弟过来  -不行
- I'd like to bring my brother here. - No.

1228
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,040
尼科斯
Nichols?

1229
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:50,110
我还没有收到我的安全许可获批的消息
I still haven't heard that my security clearance has been approved.

1230
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,150
-的确还没  -我明天要去芝加哥
- It hasn't. - I'm going to Chicago tomorrow.

1231
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:53,370
你得等
Well, you should wait.

1232
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:56,500
你知道纳粹领先我们两年时间吗
You are aware that the Nazis have a two-year head start?

1233
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,470
奥本海默博士  您的安全许可
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact that your security clearance

1234
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:00,900
难以通过并不是我的错
is proving difficult to obtain is not my fault.

1235
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:01,930
是您自己的
It's yours.

1236
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,780
也许不是你的错  但应该由你解决
It may not be your fault, but it's your problem.

1237
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,930
无论如何我要去
Because I'm going.

1238
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,750
有多少人参与了这种
And how many people were in these, uh...

1239
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,370
公开讨论
open discussions?

1240
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,780
太多了  本应按规章做好权限分隔的
Too many. Compartmentalization was supposed to be the protocol.

1241
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,330
我们当时在与纳粹竞速
We were in a race against the Nazis.

1242
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,590
现在是与苏联竞速
And now the race is against the Soviets.

1243
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:17,710
我们不发起比赛就不用比
Not unless we start it.

1244
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:21,520
罗伯特  他们刚刚打响了发令枪
Robert, they just fired the starting gun.

1245
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:24,040
他们用的是什么引爆装置
What's the nature of the device they detonated?

1246
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:27,750
看数据可能是一枚钚内爆装置
Data indicates it may have been a plutonium implosion device.

1247
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,570
正是你们在洛斯阿拉莫斯造的那种
Like the one you built at Los Alamos.

1248
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:32,080
苏联人已经有了原子弹
The Russians have a bomb.

1249
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,750
杜鲁门需要知晓下一步
Truman needs to know what's next.

1250
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:36,150
下一步  军备谈判
What's next? Arms talks.

1251
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:37,470
-军备谈判  -很显然
- Arms talks? - Obviously.

1252
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:41,640
氢弹呢  杜鲁门知道吗
What about the Super? Does Truman even know about it?

1253
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,170
我们有没有作过汇报
Did we brief him on that?

1254
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,610
没有专门汇报过
Not specifically.

1255
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,760
我们仍不知道氢弹在技术上是否可行
We still don't know if a hydrogen bomb is technically feasible.

1256
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,980
好  就我所知这是泰勒提出的
Right, my understanding is that Teller proposed it.

1257
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:51,190
-是的  -在洛斯阿拉莫斯提出的
- Yes. - At Los Alamos?

1258
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:53,560
泰勒的设计非常不切实际
Teller's designs have always been wildly impractical.

1259
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,850
按他的办法投弹要用牛车  而不是飞机
You'd have to deliver by oxcart, not airplane.

1260
01:06:56,850 --> 01:06:58,530
-奥比  -抱歉  劳伦斯博士
- Oppie! - I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence,

1261
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,230
您有话要说
do you want to comment?

1262
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,700
没有
No.

1263
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,130
因为如果氢弹能让我们再度领先
Because if it can put us ahead again,

1264
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:12,030
美国总统就应该知道这件事
the President of the United States needs to know about it.

1265
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,830
如果苏联人已经通过洛斯阿拉莫斯的间谍知道了
And if the Russians know about it already from a spy,

1266
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,900
我们必须着手研究了
at Los Alamos, then we've got to get going.

1267
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,810
没有证据表明洛斯阿拉莫斯存在间谍
There's no proof there was a spy at Los Alamos.

1268
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:23,870
罗伯特
Robert.

1269
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,430
他们的实验室在足球场底下
They put it under the football stadium?

1270
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,130
场地早就停用了
The field's not in use anymore.

1271
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,890
不相上下
Just as well.

1272
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,720
-奥比  -费米博士
- Oppie! - Dr. Fermi.

1273
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:41,330
你怎么样  还好吗
Come stai, tutto bene?

1274
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,440
-我听说你坐拥一座小镇  -没错  欢迎参观
- I hear you've got a little town. - Yes, come and see.

1275
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,060
在那种地方谁能正常思考
Who could think straight in a place like that, huh?

1276
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:51,680
大家都会被逼疯的
Everybody will go crazy.

1277
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,090
谢谢你的信任  西拉德
Thank you the vote of confidence, Szilard.

1278
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:59,080
这些也值得记
Do we really... do we really need that in the notes?

1279
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,370
你们要试验吗
Are you gonna try it out?

1280
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:02,820
已经做过了
We did.

1281
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,780
首次自持续链式核反应
The first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.

1282
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,470
格罗夫斯没告诉你吗
Didn't Groves tell you?

1283
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:10,660
没有
No.

1284
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,550
奥本海默博士
Dr. Oppenheimer?

1285
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,880
我找过人力
I tried personnel.

1286
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,540
-他们问我会不会打字  -你会吗
- They asked if I could type. - Can you?

1287
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:27,690
哈佛的化学研究生课程忘了教这个
Harvard forgot to teach that on the graduate chemistry course.

1288
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:31,900
康登  让霍尼格夫人加入钚小组
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig here on the plutonium team.

1289
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,630
你们去芝加哥干什么
What the hell were you doing in Chicago?

1290
01:08:39,830 --> 01:08:41,290
-参观大都会博物馆  -为什么
- Visiting the met. - Why?

1291
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:42,700
-你不能...  -为什么
- You can't... - Why?

1292
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,900
因为我们完全有权
Because we, we have every right...

1293
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:48,200
你有什么权利我说了算  一点不多  一点不少
You have just the rights that I give you. No more, no less.

1294
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,420
我们都是成年人  齐心协力做一个项目
We are adults trying to run a project here.

1295
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,770
这太荒谬了
This is ridiculous.

1296
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,150
说话啊
Tell him!

1297
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,490
权限分隔是我们认同的规章制度
Compartmentalization is the protocol we agreed to.

1298
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,890
我受够这个疯人院了  这种条件谁还能安心工作
Enough of this madhouse. Nobody can work under these conditions.

1299
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:05,970
告诉你吧  大将军  我不干了
You know what? Generalissimo, I quit!

1300
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,520
可太谢谢你了
Thanks for nothing.

1301
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:11,230
没了他更好
Better off without him.

1302
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,890
你不是更应该担心他的保密问题吗
Aren't you more concerned about his discretion out there?

1303
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,940
找人做掉他就好了
We'll have him killed.

1304
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,310
开玩笑的
I'm just kidding.

1305
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,070
不必  他讨厌的是我  不是美国
No, he hates me, not America.

1306
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,130
可是将军  不是所有人都像我一样有把柄可抓
You know, General, not everyone has levers to pull like mine.

1307
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:29,250
我不太明白
I don't think I understand.

1308
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,800
你招募我不是因为宽恕了我过去的左翼倾向
You didn't hire me despite my left-wing past.

1309
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,370
恰恰因为我的过去你才招募了我
You hired me because of it.

1310
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,960
这样你就能控制我
So you could control me.

1311
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,230
不  我做事没有这么含蓄
No, I'm not that subtle.

1312
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,290
我只是个普通的大头兵罢了
I'm just a humble soldier.

1313
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,500
你既不普通  也不是大头兵
You're neither humble, nor just a soldier.

1314
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,390
你在麻省理工学过工程学
You studied engineering at MIT.

1315
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,560
-被你发现了  -既然我们已经互相理解
- Guilty as charged. - Well, now we understand each other,

1316
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:48,440
也许你现在可以帮我拿到安全许可
perhaps you can get me my security clearance,

1317
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,570
让我继续为你创造奇迹
so I can perform this miracle for you.

1318
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,180
格罗夫斯将军
General Groves,

1319
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,180
您在任命奥本海默博士的时候
were you aware of Dr. Oppenheimer's left-wing associations

1320
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:01,400
是否了解他与左翼存在联系
when you appointed him?

1321
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,450
我知道有人对此有所怀疑
I was aware that there were suspicions about him.

1322
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,680
我知道他的身份背景极其自由派
I was aware he had a very extreme liberal background.

1323
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:07,490
在你看来
In your opinion,

1324
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:10,140
他是否有意识地做出过不忠于国家的行为
would he ever consciously commit a disloyal act?

1325
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:11,770
如果他做过  那我会很惊讶
I would be amazed if he did.

1326
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:14,600
所以你完全信任他的忠诚吗
So you had complete confidence in his integrity?

1327
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,110
在洛斯阿拉莫斯是的
At Los Alamos, yes.

1328
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:17,520
我真正了解他就是在那里
Which is where I really knew him.

1329
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:19,970
你知道在这个项目中  你的安全官员曾建议你
Do you know that your security officers on the project

1330
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,310
不要给奥本海默博士发放安全许可吗
advised you against the clearance of Dr. Oppenheimer?

1331
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:26,430
要不是我坚持  他们不能  也不会给他安全许可
They could not, and would not, clear him until I insisted.

1332
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,320
也就是说  你对奥本海默博士的
And it's safe to say that you had pretty good knowledge

1333
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,920
-安全档案的内容了然于胸  -是的
- of Dr. Oppenheimer's security file. - I did.

1334
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:33,010
那么今天我其实只剩下一个问题
Well, then there's only really one question

1335
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,410
希望得到解答了
I need answered here today.

1336
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:36,500
按照现行的原子能委员会准则
In light of the current AEC guidelines,

1337
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:38,890
你今天还会给奥本海默博士发放安全许可吗
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1338
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,570
你手头有这个准则吗
Do you have the guidelines?

1339
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,680
按照现行的原子能委员会准则
Under current AEC guidelines,

1340
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:53,880
你今天还会给奥本海默博士发放安全许可吗
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

1341
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:07,610
物理和新墨西哥州是吧
Physics and New Mexico, huh?

1342
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,540
老天爷  这一路可真够远的
My god. What a trek.

1343
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,510
所以你需要个联络员
That's why you need a liaison.

1344
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:14,810
我要让洛马尼茨来干
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

1345
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:18,210
你不会有事的  这边请  先生们
You're gonna be okay. This way, gentlemen.

1346
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,310
-劳伦斯博士  -莱斯利
- Dr. Lawrence. - Leslie.

1347
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:33,070
我想提醒你一句我们在伯克利谈的内容
I'd like to remind you what we talked about at Berkeley.

1348
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,970
权限分隔  我完全理解
Compartmentalization, I understand completely.

1349
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:51,660
伯克利向大家问好
Greetings from Berkeley.

1350
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:53,620
我来是为了和大家通报我们的进展
I am here to update you on our progress

1351
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:54,900
并听取大家的意见的
and solicit your input.

1352
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:57,610
因此  我不得不分享几件
To do so, I am going to have to share a few things that

1353
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,280
格罗夫斯将军不让我说的事
General Groves told me not to.

1354
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,990
抱歉将军  我说的是我理解  而不是我同意
Sorry General, I said I understood, not that I agreed.

1355
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,340
好了  先生们  说正事
Okay. Gentlemen, to business!

1356
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:08,730
有传言说洛斯阿拉莫斯
There were rumors of espionage

1357
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:11,130
-有间谍  -毫无根据
- at Los Alamos. - Unsubstantiated.

1358
01:12:11,130 --> 01:12:13,170
我听说项目里有
I'm told that there were communists

1359
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,540
-共产党  -我们并没有明明知情还雇用...
- on the project. - We didn't knowingly employ...

1360
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,910
我只想知道  他们中是否有人
I just want to know, were any of them involved

1361
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:18,450
参与了关于氢弹的讨论
in discussions of the Super?

1362
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,130
我似乎记得你要求让你弟弟来洛斯阿拉莫斯
I seem to remember you demanding your brother come to Los Alamos.

1363
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:22,840
我弟弟那时候已经不是共产党了
My brother had left the party by then.

1364
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,040
洛马尼茨呢
What about Lomanitz?

1365
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,100
洛马尼茨从来不是洛斯阿拉莫斯的工作人员
Lomanitz was never employed at Los Alamos.

1366
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:27,230
他只是联络员
He was a liaison.

1367
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,420
我们的安保没有问题
Our security was tight,

1368
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,950
前中校尼科斯很清楚这一点
as former Colonel Nichols well knows.

1369
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,200
鉴于项目涉及的人员
Our security was as tight as it could be

1370
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,710
我们的安保只能说尽可能严格
given the personalities involved,

1371
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:34,010
但确实有人试图窃密
but attempts were made.

1372
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,810
-这话是什么意思  -我们都看过他的档案
- What is that supposed to mean? - We've all read his file here.

1373
01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:39,810
难道还需要说吉恩·塔特洛克的事吗
Do we need to talk about Jean Tatlock?

1374
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,130
或者薛瓦利埃事件
Or the Chevalier incident?

1375
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:48,490
失陪
Excuse me.

1376
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,240
洛马尼茨  一号线
Lomanitz, line one!

1377
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:01,010
喂  罗西
Hello, Rossi.

1378
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:02,340
什么
What?

1379
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,310
好的  冷静
Okay, just calm down.

1380
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,510
又有件麻烦事
There's been another screwup.

1381
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,040
洛马尼茨被军队征召了
Lomanitz just got drafted.

1382
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,820
我们正在打仗  博士
We are at war, Doctor.

1383
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,020
别犯浑  尼科斯
Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

1384
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:13,130
我们需要这孩子  把这件事解决了  行吗
We need this kid. Fix it, will you?

1385
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,470
这事本就没搞错
It wasn't a mistake.

1386
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,610
你的朋友洛马尼茨一直试图成立放射性实验室工会
Your friend Lomanitz has been trying to unionize the radiation lab.

1387
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,630
-他保证过停下的  -但他没停
- He promised to quit all that. - Well, he hasn't.

1388
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:22,860
伯克利的安全官员担心
The security officer at Berkeley is concerned

1389
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,080
共党会通过那个工会渗入
about communist infiltration through that union,

1390
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,930
-叫FA...  -FAECT
- the FA... - FAECT.

1391
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,260
我下周过去的时候  我会...顺路去找他
While I'm there next week, I'll... drop in to see him.

1392
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,890
你的安全许可证下来了
Your Q clearance came through.

1393
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:42,070
重要的是
It's important

1394
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:45,100
你不要再和一些可疑的人有牵连
you not maintain or renew any questionable associations.

1395
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,220
博士  你当时是否认为
Doctor, did you think social contacts

1396
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,150
你作为接触战争机密的人
between a person engaged on secret war work

1397
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:56,680
与共产党人接触很危险
and communists was dangerous?

1398
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,540
今时今日我对这种危险有了更深刻的认知
My awareness of the danger would be greater today.

1399
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,200
那就是说  可以说在战争时期
I mean, it's fair to say that during the war years,

1400
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:06,380
你觉得此类接触是有潜在危险的
you felt that such contacts were potentially dangerous.

1401
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,110
可以想见是危险的  没错
Were conceivably dangerous, yes.

1402
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,990
说真的
I mean, really!

1403
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,370
公开的共产党人
Known communists.

1404
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:23,440
听着...
Look...

1405
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:28,670
一直以来我的脑海里都有许多秘密
I've had a lot of secrets in my head for a long time.

1406
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,290
无论我与谁交往  我都不会谈起这些秘密
Doesn't matter who I associate with, I don't talk about those secrets.

1407
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,150
你在你的声明中说
You said in your statement

1408
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:49,370
1943年你必须去见吉恩·塔特洛克
that you had to see Jean Tatlock in 1943.

1409
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:52,110
你离开了
You left.

1410
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:54,810
一句话都没留
Not a word.

1411
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:57,360
你觉得我会怎么想
What did you think that would do to me?

1412
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,910
我写过信
I wrote.

1413
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:01,610
里面一句有用的都没有
Pages of nothing.

1414
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,010
你去哪里了
Where did you go?

1415
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,490
-我不能告诉你  -为什么
- I can't tell you. - Why not?

1416
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,010
因为你是个共产党
Because you're a communist.

1417
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,770
你为什么必须去见她
Why did you have to see her?

1418
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,500
我们离开前  她表示极其想见我
She had indicated a great desire to see me before we left.

1419
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,690
那时我没能去见她  但我觉得她必须见到我
At that time I couldn't, but I felt that she had to see me.

1420
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,670
她当时正在接受精神治疗  她非常难过
She was undergoing psychiatric treatment. She was extremely unhappy.

1421
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:32,200
你弄清楚她为什么必须见你了吗
Did you find out why she had to see you?

1422
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,300
因为她依旧爱着我
Because she was still in love with me.

1423
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,490
你们共度了一夜  是吗
You spent the night together, didn't you?

1424
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,570
是的
Yes.

1425
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,910
你在我的生命中出现又离开
You drop in and out of my life,

1426
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,940
也不用和我解释为什么
and you don't have to tell me why.

1427
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:12,830
-这就是所谓的掌控权  -我也不想这样
- And that's power. - Not that I enjoy.

1428
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,570
我宁愿在你需要的时候陪着你
I'd rather be here for you as you need.

1429
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:19,070
但你如今有了更重要的事
But you have other priorities now.

1430
01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:21,520
我有了妻子和孩子
I have a wife and child.

1431
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:25,360
你我都心知肚明我们在说的不是这个
That's not what either of us is talking about.

1432
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,390
吉恩...你要我过来
Jean... you asked me to come.

1433
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,260
我也很高兴我来了
And I'm glad I did.

1434
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,910
但我之后不能再见你了
But I can't see you again.

1435
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,580
那如果我需要你怎么办
But what if I need you?

1436
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,900
你说过你一定会接的
You said you would always answer.

1437
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:52,980
不说话了吗
Not a word?

1438
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,520
你当时认为这符合安全规定吗
Did you think that consistent with good security?

1439
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,880
事实上  是符合的
As a matter of fact, it was.

1440
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,540
我什么都没说
Not a word.

1441
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,140
在此之后  你还在何时见过她
When did you see her after that?

1442
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,370
再也没见过了
I never saw her again.

1443
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,300
我还能赶上最后一班火车回普林斯顿
I can make the last train back to Princeton.

1444
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,760
吉蒂  我刚刚说的话我之前全都告诉过你
Kitty, I didn't say anything that I hadn't already told you.

1445
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,750
但今天你可是向全世界宣告了  不是吗
Today you said it to history, didn't you?

1446
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,210
这是个闭门听证会
This is a closed hearing.

1447
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:32,840
就算他们不公开笔录  我敢肯定你也会的
If they don't release the transcript, I'm sure you will.

1448
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,120
-我宣誓过的  -你对我也曾宣誓过
- I was under oath. - Well, you were under an oath to me

1449
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,500
但你还是去见吉恩了
when you went to see Jean.

1450
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,200
你知道吗  你...
You know, you...

1451
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:43,100
你坐在那里  日复一日
You sit there, day after day,

1452
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:46,070
任由他们把我们的生活撕成碎片
letting them pick our lives to pieces.

1453
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,970
你为什么不反抗
Why won't you fight?

1454
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,370
罗伯特  我不会让她作证的
Robert, I'm not putting her up there.

1455
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,910
奥本海默博士  真是荣幸  快请坐
Dr. Oppenheimer! This is an honor. Please, take a seat.

1456
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:08,070
不用了  我只是来看看我是否应该...
No need. I just wanted to check whether I should...

1457
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,440
趁着我在这里和洛马尼茨谈谈
talk to Lomanitz while I'm here,

1458
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,780
毕竟你们有所顾虑
given your concerns.

1459
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,430
我得说这其实取决于你  教授
I'd say that's really up to you, Professor,

1460
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,800
但如果是我  我会谨慎一些
but I'd be cautious.

1461
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:15,070
明白
Understood.

1462
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,680
对了  说到工会
Oh, and, um, as regards to the union,

1463
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:21,390
我想提醒你们留意一个叫埃尔滕顿的人
I wanted to give you a heads up on a man named Eltenton.

1464
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:22,330
提醒
A heads up?

1465
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,990
是的  也许他值得留意  仅此而已
Yes, just that he might bear watching, is all.

1466
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:28,800
我很乐意听听细节
I'd love to get more details.

1467
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,250
我现在有安排  而且明天一早就要离开
I have an appointment now, and I leave early tomorrow.

1468
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:33,880
明天您多早来都可以
Well, come back as early as you like.

1469
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,710
既然您现在没空
Since you haven't time now.

1470
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:38,510
你第二天早上过去了
You went back the next morning.

1471
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:40,570
是的  我不得不去
I did. I had to, really.

1472
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,110
这次在场的还有另一个人
This time there was another man.

1473
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,540
他说他姓帕什
He said his name was Pash.

1474
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:49,040
帕什  你见到了帕什上校
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

1475
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,770
帕什上校
Colonel Pash,

1476
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:54,370
你能读一下你1943年6月29日的备忘录吗
could you please read from your memo dated June 29, 1943?

1477
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:58,690
"对该对象的监视结果显示
"Results of surveillance conducted on subject

1478
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,650
其可能存在的与共产党的联系
"indicate further possible Communist Party connections."

1479
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:03,870
该对象面见了一个叫吉恩·塔特洛克的共产党
"Subject met with and spent considerable time

1480
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:06,070
并与之共度了很长一段时间
"with one Jean Tatlock, a communist,

1481
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,530
关于她的信息已附上"
"the record of whom is attached."

1482
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,170
-对象指的是奥本海默博士吗  -是的
- The subject being Dr. Oppenheimer? - Yes.

1483
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,820
你当时甚至还没见过他是吗
Whom you had not met?

1484
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,320
当时没有  但不久之后就见到了
Not then, but soon after.

1485
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,970
他是项目的安全主管  我不应该认识他吗
He's the head of security for the project. Shouldn't I know him?

1486
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,400
不  他应该认识你
No, he should know you.

1487
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:19,900
要我说我是绝不会让你和帕什共处一室的
I would never put you in a room with Pash.

1488
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:20,790
为什么
Why not?

1489
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,960
帕什第一次听说洛马尼茨的事时
When Pash first heard about Lomanitz,

1490
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:26,030
他告诉联调局他打算绑架他
he told the FBI he was going to kidnap him,

1491
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:27,400
把他带到一艘船上
take him out on a boat,

1492
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:30,360
用苏联人的方式拷问他
and interrogate him in the Russian manner.

1493
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,680
格罗夫斯将军交给了我一项任务
General Groves has placed in me a certain responsibility,

1494
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,780
感觉就像是我有一个孩子但不能见他
and it's like having a child who I can't see,

1495
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,060
只能遥控指挥
by remote control.

1496
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,040
所以见到您本人真是...
So to actually meet you is...

1497
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,900
-我不会占用您太多时间  -不不
- I won't take up too much of your time. - Oh, no.

1498
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,490
完全不会  任何时间都可以
Not at all. Whatever time you choose.

1499
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:51,940
约翰逊先生和我说了你俩昨天的对话
Mr. Johnson told me of the conversation you had yesterday,

1500
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,610
我对此非常感兴趣  也担心了一整天
which I'm very interested in. It's had me worried all day.

1501
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,740
是的  我不想在没得到许可的情况下
Yes, well, I didn't want to talk to Lomanitz

1502
01:19:57,740 --> 01:19:59,030
和洛马尼茨交谈
without authorization.

1503
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,990
我感兴趣的不是这件事
That's not the particular interest that I have.

1504
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:02,640
而是一件更加...
It's something a little bit more...

1505
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,590
在我看来  更加严重的事
In my opinion, more serious.

1506
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:06,920
然后当联调局指出
And then when the FBI pointed out

1507
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:09,880
这样得来的信息法庭不会接受时
that such information wouldn't be admissible in court,

1508
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,560
帕什清楚地表明
Pash made it clear he had no intention

1509
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:14,070
任何可以指控他的证人  他都不会留活口
of leaving any witness left to prosecute.

1510
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:15,490
幸好联调局打消了他这个念头
Now, the FBI talked him down,

1511
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:17,450
但你要对付的就是这种人
but that's the man you're dancing with.

1512
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:20,040
我了解到你听说有其他势力
I gather you've heard there are other parties

1513
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,050
对放射性实验室的工作感兴趣
interested in the work of the radiation lab?

1514
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,560
一名认识苏联领事的人
A man attached to the Soviet consul indicated,

1515
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:31,410
通过中间人向该项目的成员表示
through intermediate people, to people on this project,

1516
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:34,640
他愿意传递信息
that he was in a position to transmit information.

1517
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,290
项目里怎么会有人想要这么做呢
Well, why would anyone on the project want to do that?

1518
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:41,630
老实说  我明白也许有人认为
Frankly, I can see that there might be an argument

1519
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,670
总司令应该与苏联通气
for the commander-in-Chief informing the Russians,

1520
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:46,170
毕竟他们是我们的盟友  但是...
they're our allies, after all, but...

1521
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,660
我不喜欢偷偷摸摸这么做
I don't like the idea of it going out the back door.

1522
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,240
留意一下这件事也许没什么坏处
It might not hurt to be on the lookout for it.

1523
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:53,870
你是这么和帕什说的
And you said that to Pash.

1524
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:58,460
我是试图说明"苏联不是德国"
I was trying to put it in the context of "Russia's not Germany".

1525
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:03,060
鲍里斯·帕什的父亲是一名东正教主教
Boris Pash is the son of a Russian Orthodox bishop.

1526
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,110
他出生在美国
Born here,

1527
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:07,510
但1918年回了苏俄与布尔什维克作战
but in 1918 he went back to Russia to fight the Bolsheviks.

1528
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:10,460
这是一个亲手杀过共产党的人
This is a man who has killed communists with his own hands.

1529
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:13,400
谁该不该得到信息这件事不由我评判
I'm not the judge of who should or should not have information.

1530
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:16,160
我的职责是阻止信息非法泄露
It's my business to stop it from going through illegally.

1531
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,060
您能说得更详细些吗
Could you be a little more specific?

1532
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:24,840
有个人的名字我听过几次
There's a man whose name was mentioned to me, a couple of times,

1533
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,900
埃尔滕顿
Eltenton.

1534
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:29,730
他应该是壳牌公司的一名化学家
I believe he's a chemist who works at Shell.

1535
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,280
他与他的一个朋友交流过
He talked to a friend of his,

1536
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,100
这位朋友是项目里某人的熟人
who's an acquaintance of someone on the project.

1537
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,390
然后你以为你说到这个程度  帕什就满足了
And you thought Pash would be satisfied with that?

1538
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:42,780
我本意是把埃尔滕顿给他们
I was attempting to give them Eltenton

1539
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:44,130
但又不引起更大的麻烦
without opening a can of worms.

1540
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:45,940
我给他们编了个故事
I told them a cock-and-bull story.

1541
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,530
-你当时对格罗夫斯将军也撒谎了吗  -没有
- Did you lie to General Groves, too? - No.

1542
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:51,340
我向他坦白  我对帕什撒谎了
I admitted to him that I'd lied to Pash.

1543
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,450
你还记得关于薛瓦利埃事件的那次谈话吗
Do you recall this conversation about the Chevalier incident?

1544
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:57,420
我见过许多不同的版本...
I've seen so many versions of it, uh...

1545
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,610
之前我并不迷惑  但如今显然开始迷惑了
Wasn't confused before, but I'm certainly getting there now.

1546
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:03,500
-那么你的结论是什么  -他受到了典型的
- And what was your conclusion? - That he was under the influence

1547
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,950
美式校园男生小团体思维的影响
of the typical American schoolboy attitude

1548
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:10,390
觉得自己不能告发朋友
that there's something wicked about telling on a friend.

1549
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:14,780
那么  能告诉我这个中间人是谁吗
Well now, might we know through whom the contact was made?

1550
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:19,430
这会牵扯到和此事无关的人
That would involve people who are not to be involved in this.

1551
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:22,310
这个人是计划里的一员吗
Is that someone a member of the project?

1552
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,350
是教职人员  但没参与计划
A member of the faculty, yes, but not in the project, no.

1553
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:29,900
所以埃尔滕顿
So Eltenton made his approach

1554
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:32,300
通过伯克利的某个教职人员接触到了计划
through a member of the faculty here at Berkeley.

1555
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:37,000
据我所知  是的
As far as I know, as far as I know, yes.

1556
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,620
但可能  牵扯到不止一个人
But there... may have been... more than one person involved.

1557
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:49,360
先生们  如果我...看起来不太配合
Gentlemen, if I... if I seem uncooperative,

1558
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:52,040
我希望你们理解  因为我坚持
I think you can understand it's because of my insistence

1559
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,030
不想让无辜的人陷入麻烦
on not getting innocent people into trouble.

1560
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:57,750
你在努力保护你的朋友  谁来保护你
You're trying to protect your friend. Who's protecting you?

1561
01:22:58,030 --> 01:22:59,110
你可以
Well, you could.

1562
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:02,120
-你告诉我他的名字  -如果你命令我  我会的
- If you gave me the name... - If you order me to, I'll do it.

1563
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,410
这不对  罗伯特  你要自愿说出他是谁
That's a mistake, Robert. You need to volunteer this name.

1564
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:08,250
他给你名字了吗
Did he give you the name?

1565
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,750
-给了  -但不是当时就给了  是吗
- He did. - But not then, did he?

1566
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,670
-不  -不  事实上是几个月后  对吗
- No. - No, in fact, it was some months later, wasn't it?

1567
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:14,130
是的
It was.

1568
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:16,750
-你觉得我很固执  -你确实
- You see me as persistent. - Well, you are...

1569
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:18,970
你是很固执  但那是你的职责
you are persistent, but that is your job.

1570
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:22,560
而我的职责是保护为我工作的人
And, and my job is to protect the people that work for me.

1571
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,680
我们不想采取某些手段
Instead of us going on certain steps,

1572
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:26,390
它们也许会引起你的注意
which may come to your attention...

1573
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:30,060
让你感到不安
and be disturbing to you,

1574
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:32,390
我希望能先和你讨论一下
I would like to discuss those with you first.

1575
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:36,480
我并不是在制定计划  只是需要消化整件事
I'm not formulating a plan, I'll just have to digest the whole thing.

1576
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,210
在你审问奥本海默博士
In the months in between your interview with Dr. Oppenheimer,

1577
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:46,830
和他最终供出薛瓦利埃之间的几个月里
and his eventual naming of Chevalier,

1578
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:48,420
你是否调动了资源
did you expend resources trying to find

1579
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:52,040
-试图找出中间人的名字  -相当多的资源  是的
- the name of the intermediary? - Considerable resources, yes.

1580
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:54,670
不知道是谁的情况下  我们的工作极为困难
Without the name, our job was extremely difficult.

1581
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:56,180
你什么时候得知那个名字的
And when did you receive the name?

1582
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:58,910
奥本海默供出名字的时候  我已经离开了
I was gone by the time Oppenheimer finally offered it up.

1583
01:23:59,020 --> 01:23:59,760
离开
Gone?

1584
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,090
他们觉得我最好去欧洲
They felt my time would be better spent in Europe,

1585
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:04,630
调查纳粹炸弹计划的情况
determining the status of the Nazi bomb project.

1586
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:05,640
谁
Who did?

1587
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:08,180
格罗夫斯将军
General Groves.

1588
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,350
他把我调去了伦敦
He transferred me to London.

1589
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,240
现在办圣诞派对有点早了
It's a little early for a Christmas party.

1590
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,360
出事了
Something's up.

1591
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:22,320
托尔曼走了
Tolman's been away.

1592
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:24,360
去哪了
Where?

1593
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,110
露丝不愿意说
Ruth won't tell.

1594
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,500
拜托了  露丝
Come on, Ruthie.

1595
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:39,420
你连我都不告诉  你还能告诉谁
If you can't tell me, who can you tell?

1596
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:41,920
权限分隔  奥比
Compartmentalization, Oppie.

1597
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:44,600
你怎么就觉得我会知道他在哪呢
What makes you think I know where he is, anyway?

1598
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,060
因为在有事情的时候
Because you do a pretty good job

1599
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,760
你总是知道托尔曼先生在哪
of knowing where Mr. Tolman is when it counts.

1600
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:50,190
比如现在
Like now?

1601
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,890
全体立正
Attention!

1602
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:58,560
提前送各位的圣诞礼物
Early Christmas present for you all.

1603
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:09,080
英国飞行员让我坐进了炸弹舱
The British pilot put me in the bomb bay.

1604
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,790
他给我演示了氧气面罩  但我不会用
He showed me the oxygen, you know, but I messed it up.

1605
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,830
他们在苏格兰给我开舱时  我已经失去了意识
Um, when they opened me up in Scotland, I was unconscious.

1606
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,210
但我假装我在打盹
But I pretended I'd been napping.

1607
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:20,290
大家玩得开心
Please enjoy your party.

1608
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:24,260
-足够大吗  -大到结束这场战争吗
- Is it big enough? - To end the war?

1609
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,970
结束所有战争
To end all war.

1610
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,180
海森堡到哥本哈根找我
Uh, Heisenberg sought me out in Copenhagen.

1611
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:38,360
真让人脊背发凉  我以前的学生为纳粹效力
It was chilling, my old student working for the Nazis.

1612
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,900
他告诉了我一些事情  为了让我出山
He told me some things to draw me out.

1613
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,830
铀持续的裂变反应
Sustained fission reactions in uranium.

1614
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:48,040
这听起来更像是反应堆  而不是炸弹
That sounds more like a reactor than a bomb.

1615
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,990
他提到气相扩散了吗
Did he mention gaseous diffusion?

1616
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,670
他似乎更注重于重水
He seemed more focused on heavy water.

1617
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:55,410
-作为缓和剂  -是的  不是用石墨
- As a moderator? - Yes, instead of graphite.

1618
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,500
怎么了
What?

1619
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:01,880
他方向错了
He took a wrong turn.

1620
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:03,340
我们领先了
We're ahead.

1621
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:05,380
再加上你在这里帮我们  尼尔斯
And with you here to help us, Niels...

1622
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,180
抱歉先生们  让我们单独说几句好吗
Sorry, could you give us a moment, gentlemen?

1623
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:18,140
我不是来帮忙的  罗伯特
I am not here to help, Robert.

1624
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,350
我知道没有我你也能做到
I knew you could do this without me.

1625
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:23,060
-那你为什么来  -来谈谈以后的事
- Then why did you come? - To talk about after.

1626
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,110
你即将释放的威力将比纳粹还长久很多
The power you're about to reveal will forever outlive the Nazis.

1627
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,040
世界还没做好准备
And the world is not prepared.

1628
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:31,080
"即便没准备好应付石头下的蛇
"You can lift the stone

1629
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,460
你也可以抬起它"
without being ready for the snake that's revealed."

1630
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:36,790
我们要让政客们明白  这不是新武器
We have to make the politicians understand this isn't a new weapon.

1631
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,830
这是新世界
It's a new world.

1632
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:41,670
我在外面会尽我所能  但是你...
I'll be out there doing what I can, but you...

1633
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:45,170
你是美国普罗米修斯
You're an American Prometheus.

1634
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:49,270
你给了他们自毁的能力
The man who gave them the power to destroy themselves.

1635
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,970
他们会敬重这一点
And they'll respect that.

1636
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:53,010
你的工作才真正开始
Your work really begins.

1637
01:26:57,570 --> 01:27:00,020
抱歉  奥比  但有个电话
I'm sorry, Oppie, but there's a call.

1638
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:03,310
从旧金山打来的
From San Francisco.

1639
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,530
罗伯特
Robert!

1640
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,080
罗伯特
Robert?

1641
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:18,370
罗伯特
Robert.

1642
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,830
老天  怎么回事
God, what's the matter?

1643
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:22,750
发生什么了
What happened?

1644
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,920
她父亲打了通电话
Her father called.

1645
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,590
他昨天在浴缸里发现了她
He found her yesterday in the bath.

1646
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,010
谁
Who?

1647
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:35,550
她吃了药  留了遗书  没有署名
She's taken pills. Left a note, not signed.

1648
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:40,220
她吃了巴比妥类药物  但她的血液里有水合氯醛
She took barbiturates, but there was chloral hydrate in her blood.

1649
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:44,980
有一封遗书
There was a note.

1650
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:46,810
吉恩·塔特洛克
Jean Tatlock?

1651
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:54,610
我去见过她
We were together.

1652
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:57,200
她说她需要我  我...
She said she needed me. I...

1653
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:01,080
我告诉她我...
I told her I...

1654
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:02,200
我不该...
I wouldn't...

1655
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:03,870
我告诉她我...
I told her I...

1656
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,500
不  是因为我  是因为我
No, it was me, it was me.

1657
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:11,300
你不能自己做了坏事
You don't get to commit the sin

1658
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:15,010
却让我们所有人都因为它的后果而怜悯你
and then have us all feel sorry for you that it had consequences.

1659
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,060
马上振作起来
Now you pull yourself together.

1660
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:25,900
这里的人都靠着你
You know, people here depend on you.

1661
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:30,530
唐纳德  你能帮个忙吗
Donald, would you like to contribute here?

1662
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:31,450
-拜托  帮帮我  -你只能靠自己  伙计
- Please, help me out. - You're on your own, pal.

1663
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:34,570
鲍勃  我不会因为钚有放射性就辞职
Bob, I'm not quitting my job because plutonium is radioactive.

1664
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:37,790
只是我们不知道它对女性生殖系统有多大影响
We just don't know what it might do to the female reproductive system.

1665
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:40,630
你的生殖系统比我的暴露在外更多
Your reproductive system is more exposed than mine, presumably.

1666
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:41,830
能不能别吵了
Can we please?

1667
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,510
-内爆装置还不见踪影  -我们不能事事都急
- The implosion device is nowhere. - We can't rush everything.

1668
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:45,170
奥比  说句话啊
Oppie, please.

1669
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:47,630
着急和抓紧做是两码事  选一个吧
Well, there's rushing and there's getting on with it, so pick one.

1670
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:49,800
等等  内德梅耶正在做他该做的
Wait, wait, wait. Neddermeyer is doing his job.

1671
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,390
泰勒没干什么有用的  你没帮什么忙
Teller's not helping. You're not helping.

1672
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:55,350
我问内爆透镜的计算结果都问几周了
I've been asking for calculations on the implosion lenses for weeks.

1673
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,810
-让英国人福克斯来做嘛  -当然
- The British can do it. Fuchs. - Absolutely.

1674
01:28:57,810 --> 01:29:01,060
-那是你该做的  泰勒  -我要做研究
- It's your job, Teller. - I'm engaged in research.

1675
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:03,350
研究我们甚至不会造的氢弹
On a hydrogen bomb we're not even building!

1676
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:13,570
我不和这人合作
I won't work with that man.

1677
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:16,070
让他走
Let him go.

1678
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,530
-他太狂了  -我同意
- He's a prima donna! - I agree.

1679
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:20,120
-他应该离开洛斯阿拉莫斯  -好了
- He should leave Los Alamos. - Okay.

1680
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,710
基斯蒂  你顶替内德梅耶
Kisti, you replace Neddermeyer.

1681
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:24,250
塞斯  我要你负责钚
Seth, I'm putting you on plutonium.

1682
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:27,870
莉莉  你去配合基斯蒂  因为他需要你
Lilli, you go on for Kisti, because he needs you.

1683
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,550
福克斯  你顶替泰勒的职责
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

1684
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:31,880
我要让你专门负责内爆装置
I'm putting you exclusively on the implosion device.

1685
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:36,050
谁都不会离开洛斯阿拉莫斯
And no one is leaving Los Alamos.

1686
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:54,020
-他们不让我走  -不  是我不让你走
- They won't let me leave! - No, I won't let you leave.

1687
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:58,030
别管汉斯  别管裂变
Forget Hans, forget fission.

1688
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,820
留在这里  想研究什么就研究什么
Stay here, research what you want.

1689
01:30:01,370 --> 01:30:03,790
聚变  氢弹  什么都行
Fusion, the hydrogen bomb, whatever.

1690
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:06,580
-我们再碰面讨论  -你没时间碰面
- We'll meet to discuss it. - You don't have time to meet.

1691
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,130
你现在是政客了  罗伯特
You're a politician now, Robert.

1692
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:10,540
你很多年前就把物理抛于脑后了
You've left physics behind many, many years ago.

1693
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,750
每周一次
Once a week.

1694
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:15,130
一个小时  你和我
One hour, you and me.

1695
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:23,100
把这个该死的栏杆升起来
Now raise this fucking barrier!

1696
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:31,350
所以你在洛斯阿拉莫斯负责时  氢弹研究就开始了
So the Super was under development on your watch at Los Alamos?

1697
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:32,560
是的
Yes.

1698
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:36,620
但是战后  你试图否认其可行性
And yet, after the war, you tried to deny it was viable.

1699
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:40,120
不不不  我指出了其中的技术难题
No, no, no. I pointed out technical difficulties with it.

1700
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,740
你不是试图在苏联试爆后的
Didn't you try to kill it at the AEC meeting

1701
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,370
-原子能委员会会议上扼杀氢弹项目吗  -不
- after the Russian bomb test? - No.

1702
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:46,410
但那是原子能委员会的提议  不是吗
But that was the recommendation of the AEC, was it not?

1703
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:49,750
是数小时讨论后得出的最优解
After hours of discussion about the best response.

1704
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:55,170
氢弹的威力是原子弹的一千倍
An H-bomb is 1,000 times the power of an A-bomb.

1705
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,550
其目标只能是最大的城市
Its only intended target would be the largest cities.

1706
01:31:00,140 --> 01:31:02,270
-这是种族灭绝式的武器  -伊西
- It's a weapon of mass genocide. - Izzy.

1707
01:31:02,270 --> 01:31:04,640
在地图这边画几个圈
Draw some circles on this side of the map,

1708
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:07,310
圈出我国可能遭袭的地方  从纽约开始
where they would target us, starting with New York.

1709
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,400
-行吧  -华盛顿特区
- That's fair. - D.C.

1710
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,230
这是一种无法防御的进攻性武器
It's a weapon of attack with no defensive value.

1711
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,740
-威慑  -威慑
- Deterrence. - Deterrence?

1712
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:14,360
我们真的需要
Do we really need more deterrence

1713
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,700
比现有的原子弹更大的威慑力吗
than our current arsenal of atomic bombs?

1714
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:21,150
在三米还是三千米深的水中溺死  有什么区别
You, you drown in ten feet of water or 10,000, what's the difference?

1715
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,250
我们已经足以溺死苏联  他们知道的
We can already drown Russia. They know it...

1716
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,450
-现在他们可以溺死我们  -我们只是在升级
- Now they can drown us with... - We're just escalating...

1717
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,350
如我所说  泰勒的设计
As I said, Teller's designs are still

1718
01:31:38,350 --> 01:31:41,390
依然像战时一样不切实际
as impractical as they were during the war.

1719
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:44,180
氢弹是可以造出来的  奥比  你知道的
A hydrogen bomb can be made to work, Oppie. You know that.

1720
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:47,190
我觉得我们不该把所有的资源都赌在那个概率上
I don't believe we should commit all our resources to that chance.

1721
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:50,230
那你该怎样让杜鲁门打消美国人民的顾虑呢
Then how would you have Truman reassure the American people?

1722
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:52,650
只需要通过对核能的国际管控
Simply by limiting the spread of atomic weapons

1723
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:55,100
限制核武器的扩散
through international control on nuclear energy.

1724
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,740
你是指世界政府
By which you mean world government.

1725
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:00,370
联合国  正如罗斯福所设想
The United Nations, as Roosevelt intended.

1726
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:04,250
我问的是杜鲁门该怎么做  好吗  世界已经变了
Well, I asked what Truman should do, right? The world's changed.

1727
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:08,120
现在威胁我们生存的不是法西斯主义而是共产主义
It's not fascism but communism that now threatens our survival.

1728
01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:11,670
路易斯  你是否明白  如果我们造了氢弹
Lewis, do you understand, if we build a hydrogen bomb,

1729
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:14,010
苏联人也不得不造他们自己的
the Russians will have no choice but to build their own?

1730
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:15,880
他们有没有可能已经在造了
Could they be working on one already?

1731
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:18,640
基于间谍从洛斯阿拉莫斯收集的情报
Based on information gathered from the spy at Los Alamos...

1732
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,220
-洛斯阿拉莫斯没有间谍  -先生们
- No spy at Los Alamos. - Gentlemen...

1733
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:22,630
-没有吗  -我们别偏题
- There wasn't? - Let's not get sidetracked.

1734
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,810
我是说我们要通过承诺不造氢弹
I say we use this moment to gain concessions from the Russians

1735
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:28,900
来获得苏联人的让步
by committing that we will not build a hydrogen bomb.

1736
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,730
这样会透露氢弹是存在的
Thereby revealing its existence.

1737
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:32,810
你似乎很确信他们已经知道了
Which you seem convinced they already know.

1738
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:33,560
好了
Alright.

1739
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:37,700
现在我希望委员会成员私下会面
At this point, I'd like the committee members to meet in privacy

1740
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,980
敲定我们的提议
to finalize our recommendations.

1741
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,540
我只是不确定你想要走上这条路
I'm just not sure you want to go down this route.

1742
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,790
路易斯  不是不尊重  我们是咨询委员会
Lewis, with respect, we are the advisory committee.

1743
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:47,240
我们应该给出我们的意见
We will give them our advice.

1744
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:48,490
晚安
Good night.

1745
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,120
奥本海默博士  您好
Dr. Oppenheimer? Hi.

1746
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:58,300
威廉·波登  国会原子能联合委员会的
William Borden. Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.

1747
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,790
是的  是的
Oh, yes, yes.

1748
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,130
战争期间  我是一名飞行员
During the war, I was a pilot.

1749
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:07,230
有一天夜里  我突袭回来  看到了惊人的一幕
One night, flying back from a raid, I saw an amazing sight.

1750
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:11,060
像流星一样  一枚V2火箭冲向英国
Like a meteor. A V2 rocket headed to England.

1751
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:13,820
我忍不住想象
I can't help but imagine what it will be

1752
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:18,150
这样的敌军火箭载着核弹头会是什么样
for such an enemy rocket to carry an atomic warhead.

1753
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:29,410
我们要确保这种情况不会发生
Let's make sure we're not the ones to make that possible.

1754
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,370
奥比  你应该不想和施特劳斯作对吧
Oppie, I don't think you want to go up against Strauss.

1755
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,210
如果我俩都发言  其他人会听我的
If we both speak, they listen to me.

1756
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,510
他们听你说话像先知
When you speak, they hear a prophet.

1757
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:45,680
他们听施特劳斯说话才像常人
When Strauss speaks, they hear themselves.

1758
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,010
他们会听先知的
They'll listen to a prophet.

1759
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,720
先知不能出错  一次都不行
A prophet can't be wrong. Not once.

1760
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,020
你是否指责过奥本海默
Did you accuse Oppenheimer

1761
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:54,190
蓄意破坏了氢弹的研发
of sabotaging the development of the Super?

1762
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:58,480
我从来不会滥用"蓄意破坏"这类词
I was never one of those to bandy around terms like sabotage.

1763
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:00,150
但波登先生会
But Mr. Borden was?

1764
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,400
据我的理解  有可能
As I understand it, possibly.

1765
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:06,200
波登先生是如何整理出一份如此详尽的起诉书的
How was Mr. Borden able to put together such a detailed indictment?

1766
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,830
他当时已不是政府雇员
He was no longer a government employee,

1767
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:10,210
但他似乎可以不受任何限制地
yet he appears to have had unlimited access

1768
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:11,870
查阅奥本海默博士的档案
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

1769
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:14,460
有可能是尼科斯先生把这些文件给他的吗
Might Mr. Nichols have given him access to the file?

1770
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:16,960
还是原子能委员会的某个人
Or someone else at the AEC?

1771
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,910
这是一个非常严重的指控  参议员
That's a very serious accusation, Senator.

1772
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:20,970
你是不是在暗示
Is it your intention to suggest that

1773
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:24,040
奥本海默博士背叛了美国
Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States?

1774
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:26,680
我一直认为  到现在仍然认为
I've always assumed, and still assume,

1775
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:28,550
他忠于美国
that he's loyal to the United States.

1776
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:30,930
我坚信  也会继续坚信这一点
I believe this, and I shall believe it,

1777
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:33,600
除非我看到非常确凿的反驳证据
until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

1778
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:37,890
你认为奥本海默博士是安全风险吗
Do you or do you not believe that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

1779
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,700
恕我直言  希特勒在地堡里举枪自尽后
If I may, look, when Hitler blew his brains out in that bunker,

1780
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:52,120
我认为这枚炸弹
it is my humble opinion that there is no need

1781
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,950
就没必要再离开这个试验场地了
for that bomb to be seen anywhere except that test site.

1782
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,920
我们至少应该停下来思考一下
Well, we at least have to take a moment to think about

1783
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,370
手段是否还能证明目的的正当性  因为...
whether the means justify the ends any longer because...

1784
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:06,670
德国就快投降了
Germany is about to surrender.

1785
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:12,560
敌人不再是对人类最大的威胁
It's no longer the enemy who are the greatest threat to mankind.

1786
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:13,760
我们的工作才是
It's our work.

1787
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:18,720
希特勒死了  没错
Hitler's dead. It's true.

1788
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,020
但日本人还在顽抗
But the Japanese fight on.

1789
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,980
他们的战败似乎已成定局
Their defeat seems assured.

1790
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:26,480
正要奔赴前线的大兵可不会这么认为
Not if you're a G.I. preparing to invade.

1791
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:29,330
我们可以结束这场战争
We can end this war.

1792
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:30,790
但要如何才能证明
But how do we justify

1793
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:32,610
对人类使用这种武器是合乎道义的
using this weapon on human beings?

1794
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,040
我们研究的是理论  对吧
We're theorists. Yes?

1795
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:44,960
我们想象未来  但这一想象让我们恐惧
We imagine a future, and our imaginings horrify us.

1796
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,970
他们只有理解了才会害怕
They won't fear it until they understand it,

1797
01:35:47,970 --> 01:35:50,510
而他们只有用过才能理解
and they won't understand it until they've used it.

1798
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:54,380
洛斯阿拉莫斯的可怕秘密公诸于世后
When the world learns the terrible secret of Los Alamos,

1799
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:58,310
我们在这里的工作将确保人类前所未有的和平
our work here will ensure a peace mankind has never seen.

1800
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:01,360
这种建立在国际合作上的和平
A peace based on the kind of international cooperation

1801
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,770
正是罗斯福一直设想的
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

1802
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:11,780
-进展如何  -两年时间  花费十亿美元
- Progress? - Two years and a billion dollars' worth.

1803
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:15,960
-难以估价  -不难  把账单加起来就知道了
- Hard to put a price on it. - Not really, just add up the bills.

1804
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,880
农村免费包裹投递[接生]Rural free deliveries.

1805
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,990
第一年就降生了80个新生儿
80 babies delivered the first year.

1806
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,450
今年一个月就多出了10个孩子
This year we've had ten, a month.

1807
01:36:23,010 --> 01:36:25,870
节育问题有点超出我的管辖范围了  将军
Birth control is a little out of my jurisdiction, General.

1808
01:36:26,590 --> 01:36:28,000
-很明显  -将军
- Clearly. - General.

1809
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:36,760
趴下  各位  福克斯  趴下
Head down, everybody. Fuchs, head down.

1810
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,270
就是这样
That's the one!

1811
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:47,100
两枚可引爆的炸弹
Two viable bombs.

1812
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,150

01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:02,660
但我需要我弟弟

1820
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:09,430
弗兰克了解这片沙漠  他已经放下政治了
Frank knows the desert. He's left politics behind.

1821
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:11,550
他已经和劳伦斯共事两年了
He's been working with Lawrence for two years now.

1822
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:20,100
试验要叫什么
What do we call the test?

1823
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:25,430
"猛击我的心吧  三位一体的上帝"[约翰·邓恩《圣十四行诗》]"Batter my heart, three-person'd God."

1824
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,350
什么

01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,400
三位一体
Trinity.

1826
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:39,290
你坚持要让你的弟弟弗兰克加入

1827
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:40,460

1830
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:48,050
引入了美国最机密也最重要的国防项目
onto America's most secret and important defense project.

1831

我知道我的弟弟可以被信任  毋庸置疑
I knew my brother could be trusted. Absolutely.

1832
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:52,840
你认为自己对团队中谁可以信任的判断
And you thought your judgment was sound

1833
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:54,760
是正确的吗

1834
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,550
福克斯  低头

1835

希望你们有收获

是的  知道了下次的安全距离要远得多
Yeah, we've learned we're gonna need to be a lot further away.

1838
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:13,360
快点搞清楚
Well, figure it out, fast.

1839
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:14,820
明天一早我们就去华盛顿

You're a long way from Chicago, Leo.

我们在造原子弹

1846
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:46,140
并不代表我们能决定怎么用
doesn't mean we get to decide how it's used.

1847
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:48,390
历史会评判我们的  罗伯特
History will judge us, Robert.

你怎么知道  是你把我们卷入这一切的

你和爱因斯坦

写信给罗斯福说我们可以造一个炸弹

1856
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,420

1860
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:21,720
他们不是你  你是科学界最厉害的推销员
They're not you. You're the great salesman of science.

1861
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:24,140
你可以说服任何人
You can convince anyone of anything.

1862

I worry about America when we do these things and no one protests.

1866

珍珠港事件

1867
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:42,330
再加上太平洋地区持续三年的血战
and three years of brutal conflict in the Pacific,

1868
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:44,950
极大地提高了美国民众的容忍度
buys a lot of latitude with the American public.

1869
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,950
高到可以容忍投放原子弹吗
Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?

1870
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,580
原子弹造成的破坏可能不会像东京轰炸那么严重
Uh, the A-bomb might not cause as much damage as the Tokyo bombings.

1871
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,050
预估的数字呢
What are we estimating?

1872
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:53,870
在一个中型城市
In a medium-sized city, uh...

1873
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,930
两万到三万死亡
20,000 or 30,000 dead.

1874
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,100
没错  但也不要低估
Yes, but don't underestimate

1875
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:02,920
原子弹爆炸带来的心理冲击
the psychological impact of an atomic explosion.

1876
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:06,600
三千米高的火柱
A pillar of fire, 10,000 feet tall,

1877
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:10,480
方圆上下1.6千米的致命中子辐射效应
deadly neutron effects for a mile, in all directions,

1878
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,320
仅通过一个装置
from one single device.

1879
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,320
从一架隐蔽的B-29轰炸机上
Dropped from a barely-noticed B-29,

1880
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,060
投下的原子弹将会是...
the atomic bomb will be...

1881
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:20,820
神力的骇人展示
a terrible revelation of divine power.

1882
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:23,780
果真如此的话  这将是决定性的一击
If that's true, it would be definitive.

1883
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,780
二战将会结束
World War II would be over.

1884
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,620
我们的大兵也就可以回家了
Our boys would come home.

1885
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,160
打击军事目标吗
Military targets?

1886
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,290
但没有足够大的军事目标
But there aren't any big enough.

1887
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:35,220
命脉军工厂怎么样
Perhaps a vital war plant,

1888
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,880
工人居住在附近的那种
with workers housed nearby.

1889
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:40,890
我们可以发布警告  减少平民伤亡
And we could issue a warning to reduce civilian casualties.

1890
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:43,550
他们为了击落那架飞机  会用上一切武器
They'd send everything they have up against us,

1891
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:45,220
到时候坐在机舱里的人是我
and I'd be up in that plane.

1892
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:48,100
如果我们事先宣布了  炸弹没能爆炸
If we announce it, and it fails to go off,

1893
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:51,100
迫使日本投降的任何机会也就烟消云散
we'd scupper any chance of a Japanese surrender.

1894
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:54,360
没有别的办法向日本展示核弹的效果
Is there no way to demonstrate a bomb to Japan

1895
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:55,440
迫使其投降吗
to provoke surrender?

1896
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,770
我们打算以最清楚明确的方式展示效果
We intend to demonstrate it in the most unambiguous terms.

1897
01:40:58,990 --> 01:40:59,900
展示两次
Twice.

1898
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:01,870
第一次是为了展示武器的威力
Once to show the weapon's power,

1899
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:05,530
第二次是为了表明我们可以扔到他们投降为止
and a second to show that we can keep doing this until they surrender.

1900
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:08,370
我们列出了12个城市
We have a list of 12 cities to choose from.

1901
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,200
抱歉  是11个
Sorry, 11.

1902
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,840
我从中删掉了京都
I've taken Kyoto off the list,

1903
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:15,580
因为这座城市对日本人民具有重要的文化意义
due to its cultural significance to the Japanese people.

1904
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:19,000
还有我和夫人的蜜月是在那度的
Also, my wife and I honeymooned there.

1905
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:20,960
那座城市了不起
It's a magnificent city.

1906
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:26,060
简单点说  先生们
Let me make this simple for you, gentlemen.

1907
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:28,600
根据我手上无法向各位透露的情报
According to my intelligence, which I cannot share with you,

1908
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:30,680
日本人不会投降
the Japanese people will not surrender,

1909
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,640
不管在什么情况下
under any circumstances,

1910
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:36,230
除非我们成功全面入侵日本本土
short of a successful and total invasion of the home islands.

1911
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:39,150
但这样许多人将丧命  无论是美国人还是日本人
Many lives would be lost, American and Japanese.

1912
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:43,440
向日本城市投原子弹将能挽救生命
The use of the atomic bomb on Japanese cities will save lives.

1913
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,690
前提是我们保留道德优势
If we retain moral advantage.

1914
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:48,250
-怎么说  -如果我们使用这个武器
- How so? - Well, if we use this weapon

1915
01:41:48,250 --> 01:41:50,670
而未通知我们的盟友  他们会把这视为威胁
without informing our allies, they'll see it as a threat,

1916
01:41:50,670 --> 01:41:52,160
我们会陷入军备竞赛
and we'll be in an arms race.

1917
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:54,420
对苏联人我们能坦诚到什么程度
How open can we be with the Soviets?

1918
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:58,670
保密无法阻止苏联人造出原子弹
Secrecy won't stop the Soviets from becoming part of the atomic world.

1919
01:41:58,670 --> 01:42:02,090
-情报显示他们没有铀  -情报错了
- We've been told they have no uranium. - You've been misinformed.

1920
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:03,800
苏联造出核弹只是时间问题
A Russian bomb is a matter of time.

1921
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:07,130
战争结束后  这一项目仍要继续全速推进
The program needs to continue at full pace after the war.

1922
01:42:08,270 --> 01:42:09,930
史汀生部长  恕我直言
Secretary Stimson, if I may,

1923
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:13,900
并非所有参与项目的科学家都同意
not all scientists on the project are in agreement.

1924
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:16,930
事实上  现在也许是时候考虑其他意见了
In fact, this might be a moment to consider other opinions.

1925
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:17,820
如果你和科学家们交流...
If you talk to scientists...

1926
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:19,440
曼哈顿计划一开始
The Manhattan Project has been plagued

1927
01:42:19,450 --> 01:42:22,560
就备受某些不够可靠
from the start by certain scientists of...

1928
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:25,490
忠诚度值得怀疑的科学家们的侵扰
doubtful discretion, and uncertain loyalty.

1929
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:27,570
其中一位最近甚至试图接触总统
One of 'em just tried to meet with the President.

1930
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:29,150
现在  我们还需要他们
Now, we need these men,

1931
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,660
但一旦核弹完成
but as soon as it's practical,

1932
01:42:30,660 --> 01:42:33,040
我们就应该立即将这些科学家从项目中剔除
we should sever any such scientists from the program.

1933
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,490
你不赞成吗  博士
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

1934
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,040
如果苏联造出核弹不可避免
If a Russian bomb is inevitable,

1935
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:41,340
也许我们应该邀请他们的顶尖科学家参加三位一体
perhaps we should invite their top scientist to Trinity.

1936
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:45,010
杜鲁门总统并不打算让斯大林参与原子弹项目
President Truman has no intention of raising expectations

1937
01:42:45,010 --> 01:42:47,760
也不想提高这方面的期望
that Stalin be included in the atomic project.

1938
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:49,430
向他通知我们的突破
Informing him of our breakthrough,

1939
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:51,350
并将其作为赢得战争的手段
and presenting it as a means to win the war,

1940
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:53,260
无需做出无法兑现的承诺
need not make unkeepable promises.

1941
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:55,360
但是  七月的波茨坦和平会议
But, the Potsdam Peace Conference in July

1942
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,640
将是杜鲁门总统最后一次进行这样对话的机会
will be President Truman's last chance to have that conversation.

1943
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:01,730
到时你能给我们一枚能用的炸弹吗
Can you give us a working bomb by then?

1944
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:03,810
当然
Absolutely.

1945
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:05,820
我们会在会议前进行试爆
We will test fire before the conference.

1946
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:11,790
试爆点
Ground zero.

1947
01:43:11,790 --> 01:43:17,090
北方  南方和西方九千米各有一处观测点
Observation posts at 10,000 yards, north, south, and west.

1948
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:20,040
-在哪操作引爆  -南方  九千米
- Where do we trigger from? - South, 10,000.

1949
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:23,830
大本营在南方约16千米处
And base camp is ten miles south here.

1950
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:29,390
32千米外的那座山上还有一个远端观测点
And there's a further observation post on that hill, 20 miles away.

1951
01:43:29,390 --> 01:43:31,800
那是在做什么  弗兰克  触发线不是早埋好了
What's that, Frank? Trigger lines already went in.

1952
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:35,650
空军要求为他们的B-29轰炸机装一排灯
The Air Force requested a line of lights for their B-29.

1953
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:38,060
什么B-29  我们的炸弹在塔上
What B-29? Our bomb's on the tower.

1954
01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:39,400
他们想利用这次试验
They want to use the test

1955
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,070
-确认安全操作距离  -太冒险了
- to confirm a safe operating distance. - That's risky.

1956
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:43,780
总比不上往日本投核弹的时候
But not as risky as dropping one over Japan,

1957
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:45,990
还得祈祷我们没把爆炸半径算错
and hoping that we were right about the blast radius.

1958
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:48,280
别让他们拖慢进度  我们在15号就要引爆
Don't let 'em slow us down, we're firing on the 15th.

1959
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,940
-15号  不是...  -就是15号
- The 15th? That's not... - The 15th.

1960
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:53,320
15号
15th.

1961
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,920
我会在南观测点这里
So I'll be here at South Observation Point

1962
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:58,910
和弗兰克还有基斯蒂亚科夫斯基一起
with Frank and Kistiakowsky.

1963
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:02,010
你们将被分配到大本营
You'll all be assigned to Base Camp,

1964
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:04,710
西观测点或是远端观测点
West Observation, or Far Observation.

1965
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:16,800
小心用刀
Careful with that knife.

1966
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:21,560
这些是安全距离吗
Are those safe distances?

1967
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,690
这些距离是基于你的计算
They're based on your calculations.

1968
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:27,110
是时候亲自站在你的科学身后了  汉斯
Time to stand behind your science, Hans. Literally.

1969
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:58,180
辐射云呢
What about the radiation cloud?

1970
01:44:58,350 --> 01:45:01,360
没有强风的情况下  应该会在三到五千米内沉降
Without high winds, it should settle within 2-3 miles.

1971
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,430
疏散措施也已就位
Evacuation measures are in place.

1972
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:06,810
但我们需要能见度  所以天气必须好
But we need good weather for visibility, so it has to be fine.

1973
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,190
都出去
Everybody out!

1974
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:22,630
我们15号夜里进行  不能再晚了
We go on the night of the 15th. It's a hard deadline.

1975
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:25,370
有问题就现在提
So if anyone has anything, speak now.

1976
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,540
好的  停  停  所有人  垫子
Okay, stop, stop! Everybody, mattresses.

1977
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,880
把垫子放这里  正下方
Put the mattress there, underneath.

1978
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:51,190
我们还需要做最后一次内爆试验
We could use a final implosion test.

1979
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,820
-没什么坏处  -做吧
- It couldn't hurt. - Do it.

1980
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,160
还有什么能阻止我们的吗
Is there anything else that might stop us?

1981
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:35,360
要试爆了  是不是
It's happening, isn't it?

1982
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:38,860
我会捎个信的
I'll send a message.

1983
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,240
如果成功
If it's gone our way:

1984
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,080
"收床单"
"Take in the sheets."

1985
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:49,000
罗伯特
Robert.

1986
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:53,290
祝你好运
Break a leg.

1987
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:08,020
看
Look.

1988
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:03,200
奥比非常保守地选了只有三千吨的奖券
Oppie's taken a very modest three kilotons.

1989
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:05,500
-泰勒选了四万五千吨  -两万吨
- Teller's view is 45. - 20!

1990
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,830
两万吨TNT当量
20,000 tons of TNT.

1991
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,540
有人想要这张吗  会出现把大气层点着的副反应
And does anyone want the side action on atmospheric ignition?

1992
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,500
你是说我们不得不推迟吗
Are you saying we'll have to delay?

1993
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,010
我是说  谨慎的做法是推迟
I'm saying it would be prudent.

1994
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:18,800
这场暴风雨已经到试验场了吗
This weather, has it reached the site?

1995
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:26,520
贝特打来告诉你内爆试验失败了
Bethe is calling to tell you the implosion test failed.

1996
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,930
喂  汉斯  是的  他在这
Hello, Hans? Yes, he's here.

1997
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:30,970
是的
Yes.

1998
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:34,640
是他错了吗
Is he wrong?

1999
01:48:34,990 --> 01:48:36,400
-不是  -不是吗
- No. - No?

2000
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:37,480
不是
No.

2001
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:39,860
所以我们是要试一枚哑弹吗
So we're about to fire a dud?

2002
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,780
-不是  -解释啊
- No. - Explain!

2003
01:48:41,790 --> 01:48:43,330
我无法解释  我...
Well, I can't. I just, I...

2004
01:48:43,330 --> 01:48:45,750
我就是知道内爆透镜一定会成功
I just know, I know the implosion lenses will work.

2005
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:48,500
如果我们点燃引爆装置却未引发反应
If we fire these detonators and they don't trigger a reaction,

2006
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:51,960
这两年生产的钚就全都会散落在白沙国家公园
two years' worth of plutonium will be scattered across White Sands.

2007
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:54,910
我用一个月工资和你赌十块  能引爆
A month of my salary against ten bucks says it lights.

2008
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:56,830
老天
Oh, Jesus!

2009
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:07,230
试爆点风力增强  雨势不变  电闪雷鸣
The wind's pickin' up at zero, not the rain. Lightning's circling.

2010
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:09,520
就这天气  还想让你的人
Think it might be time to tell your men to get away

2011
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,930
离开架设着核弹的钢架台吗
from the steel tower with the atomic bomb?

2012
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,990
我们去南观测点
Let's get to South Observation.

2013
01:49:16,990 --> 01:49:19,150
让他们撤  我们可以到那里再做决定
Pull 'em out, and we can make our determination there.

2014
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,110
团队已经两晚没合眼了
The team hasn't slept in two nights!

2015
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:29,170
如果我们叫停  保证核弹安全
If we stand down and make the bomb safe,

2016
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:30,500
得花好几周才能再次准备好
we won't be back here for weeks!

2017
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:32,200
就会错过波茨坦会议
And we'll miss Potsdam!

2018
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:35,550
我要在7点前告诉杜鲁门  我们快错过时机了
I gotta get word to Truman by seven, our window's closing.

2019
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:37,800
-现在是怎么回事  -暴雨  狂风  闪电
- What is this doing? - Raining, blowing, lightning.

2020
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,050
-还要多久  该死  -坚持住
- For how long, damnit? - Holdin' strong!

2021
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:41,630
黎明前就会停
It'll break before dawn.

2022
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,300
-你怎么知道  -我了解这片沙漠
- How could you know that? - I know this desert.

2023
01:49:43,310 --> 01:49:46,340
暴风雨在夜间减弱  在黎明前就能停
Storm cools overnight. Just before dawn, storm breaks.

2024
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:47,140
你也许说得对
You could be right,

2025
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:49,800
-但要尽可能迟一点  -五点半
- but schedule as late as possible. - Five-thirty.

2026
01:49:50,270 --> 01:49:52,940
签字画押  要是你错了  我就绞死你
Sign your forecast. If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

2027
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:56,020
-通知全体  五点半  -五点半  五点半
- Tell 'em all. Five-thirty. - Five-thirty, five-thirty!

2028
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:03,620
三年  四千人  二十亿美元
Three years, 4,000 people, two billion dollars.

2029
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:05,360
这要是没爆炸
Well, if it doesn't go off,

2030
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:07,490
我俩全完了
we're both finished.

2031
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:12,080
我赌三千吨
I'm betting on three kilotons.

2032
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,080
再少  他们就感受不到它的威力了
Anything less, they won't get what it is.

2033
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:19,420
费米说点燃大气层是什么意思
Now, what did Fermi mean by, uh, atmospheric ignition?

2034
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:21,840
我们曾一度认为  核装置的链式反应
Well, we had a moment where it looked like the chain reaction

2035
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,420
也许永远不会停
from an atomic device might never stop.

2036
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:27,420
点燃大气层
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

2037
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:30,180
为什么费米还搞这个附加赌注
Why's Fermi still taking side bets on it?

2038
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,510
算是黑色幽默吧
Call it gallows humor.

2039
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:39,980
等等  就是说当我们按下那个按钮时
Wait, are we saying there's a chance that when we push that button,

2040
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:41,570
有可能会毁灭世界吗
we destroy the world?

2041
01:50:41,570 --> 01:50:44,770
我们过去三年的研究并不支持这一结论
Nothing in our research over three years supports that conclusion,

2042
01:50:45,370 --> 01:50:48,490
除非是小概率事件
except as the most remote possibility.

2043
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,320
-多小  -概率几近于零
- How remote? - Chances are near-zero.

2044
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:54,080
几近于零
Near-zero?

2045
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,700
只有理论  还想要什么呢
What do you want from theory alone?

2046
01:50:59,010 --> 01:51:01,170
是零最好
Zero would be nice.

2047
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:07,210
确切来说  1小时...
In exactly one hour...

2048
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:10,510
58分钟后  我们就知道了
and 58 minutes, we'll know.

2049
01:51:17,190 --> 01:51:18,180
天气正在转好
It's letting up.

2050
01:51:31,290 --> 01:51:33,460
部队已经离开试爆点  他们正在赶往这里
The arming party's left zero, they're heading this way.

2051
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:34,660
打开开关
Throw on your switches.

2052
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:37,620
掉转车头  做好紧急疏散的准备
Turn the cars! Ready for emergency evacuation.

2053
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:58,890
...焊工镜片  各就各位
...welder's glass. Everybody take their places.

2054
01:51:59,190 --> 01:52:01,230
每人都拿一个焊工镜片
Everybody take a welder's glass!

2055
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:57,320
20分钟
20 minutes.

2056
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:02,700
20分钟
20 minutes!

2057
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:15,050
20分钟
That's 20!

2058
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:19,930
放我腿上谢谢
On the leg, please.

2059
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,310
-费曼  -不用了
- Feynman? - No.

2060
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:26,060
车玻璃能阻挡紫外线
The glass stops the UV.

2061
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:27,650
要是玻璃碎了可怎么办呢
What stops the glass?

2062
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:30,690
我去大本营了
I'm heading to base camp.

2063
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:31,870
祝你好运
Best of luck.

2064
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:33,580
罗伯特
Robert?

2065
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:36,660
尽量别把世界给炸了
Try not to blow up the world.

2066
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:49,940
盯住那个指针
Watch that needle.

2067
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:51,400
如果引爆装置没充电
If the detonators don't charge,

2068
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,270
电压掉到一伏以下
and the voltage drops below one volt,

2069
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,560
就按那个按钮中止  明白了吗
you hit that button, you abort. Understood?

2070
01:53:56,740 --> 01:53:57,810
明白了
Understood.

2071
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,490
两分钟后引爆
Two minutes to detonation.

2072
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:08,870
全体趴下
Everybody down!

2073
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:12,950
看到山上反光之前不要转身
Do not turn around until you see light reflected on the hills.

2074
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:16,550
然后只能通过焊工镜片观察爆炸
Then look at the explosion only through your welder's glass.

2075
01:54:16,550 --> 01:54:19,630
90秒后引爆
90 seconds to detonation.

2076
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:23,760
80秒后引爆
80 seconds to detonation.

2077
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:25,380
搽上了吗
Is it rubbed in?

2078
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,090
是的
Yeah.

2079
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:37,010
60秒后引爆
60 seconds to detonation.

2080
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,780
这些事让人揪心
These things are hard on your heart.

2081
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:55,090
30秒
30 seconds.

2082
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:02,210
引爆装置充电完毕
Detonators charged!

2083
01:55:12,230 --> 01:55:13,600
17.

2084
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:15,190
16.

2085
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:16,770
15.

2086
01:55:16,980 --> 01:55:18,390
14.

2087
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:20,270
13.

2088
01:55:20,650 --> 01:55:21,730
12.

2089
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:23,190
11.

2090
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:24,900
Ten.

2091
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,070
Nine.

2092
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,120
Eight.

2093
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:31,410
Seven.

2094
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:33,950
Six.

2095
01:55:35,830 --> 01:55:36,790
Five.

2096
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:39,290
Four.

2097
01:55:41,050 --> 01:55:41,870
Three.

2098
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:44,540
Two.

2099
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:46,610
One.

2100
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:22,220
"如今  我已成为死神"
"And now I am become Death...

2101
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:26,690
"世界的毁灭者"
the destroyer of worlds."

2102
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:01,100
成功了
It worked.

2103
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:38,220
你欠我十美元
You owe me ten dollars!

2104
01:58:40,730 --> 01:58:43,970
-快拿来  -我愿赌服输  基斯蒂
- Come on! - I... I'm good for it, Kisti.

2105
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:45,220
确实
You are!

2106
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:47,770
是的  你确实
Yes, you are!

2107
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:26,890
立刻给我接波茨坦
Get me Potsdam right away.

2108
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:39,730
捎个信给吉蒂
Get a message to Kitty.

2109
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:42,910
-我们什么都不能说  -告诉她收床单
- We can't say anything. - Tell her to take in the sheets.

2110
01:59:58,140 --> 01:59:59,890
-喂  -喂  吉蒂吗
- Hello? - Hi, Kitty?

2111
01:59:59,890 --> 02:00:03,470
什么什么  夏洛特  你说你说
What? What? Charlotte? Charlotte, go ahead. Go ahead.

2112
02:00:03,770 --> 02:00:04,680
我不太清楚
Well, I don't know,

2113
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:07,560
他就告诉我让你收床单
he just said to tell you to bring in the sheets.

2114
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:11,060
吉蒂
Kitty?

2115
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:15,690
吉蒂  吉蒂你还在听吗
Kitty? Kitty, are you still there?

2116
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,250
如果在过高的空中引爆
If they detonate it too high in the air,

2117
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:26,040
爆炸威力不会这么强
the blast won't be as powerful.

2118
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:29,830
恕我直言  奥本海默博士  接下来就由我们负责了
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer, we'll take it from here.

2119
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:42,920
杜鲁门在波茨坦跟斯大林通气了吗
Did Truman brief Stalin at Potsdam?

2120
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:45,640
"通气"有点夸张了
"Brief" would be an overstatement.

2121
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:49,770
他提到了一种颇具威力的新型武器
He referred to a powerful new weapon.

2122
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:55,270
斯大林...希望我们用它对付日本
Stalin... hoped we'd use it against Japan.

2123
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:57,060
就这样吗
That's it?

2124
02:00:57,870 --> 02:00:59,780
罗伯特  我们已经给了他们王牌
Robert, we've given them an ace.

2125
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:01,490
打牌的是他们
It's for them to play the hand.

2126
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:04,900
你打算6号用吗
You're aiming for the sixth?

2127
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,950
这取决于太平洋司令
It's up to the CO in the Pacific.

2128
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:11,080
要我和你一起去华盛顿吗
Should I come with you to Washington?

2129
02:01:12,670 --> 02:01:13,580
去做什么
What for?

2130
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:17,880
那你有消息随时告诉我
Well, you keep me informed.

2131
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:20,210
当然
Of course.

2132
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:23,670
尽我所能
As best I can.

2133
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:44,570
日本人如果知道接下来发生的事会投降吗
Would the Japanese surrender if they knew what was coming?

2134
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:46,960
我不清楚
I don't know.

2135
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:51,620
你看过西拉德的请愿书吗
Have you seen Szilard's petition?

2136
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:54,120
西拉德怎么可能了解日本人
How the hell does Szilard know about the Japanese?

2137
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:55,960
你不打算签吧
You're not signing it, are you?

2138
02:01:56,670 --> 02:01:59,000
很多人签了  许多
Many people have. A lot of people.

2139
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:00,040
爱德华...
Edward...

2140
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:04,470
我们是造了这枚炸弹  但这并没有赋予我们
the fact that we built this bomb does not give us any more,

2141
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:06,350
任何多于常人的权利或责任
any more right or responsibility

2142
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:08,850
来决定如何使用它
to decide how it's used than anyone else.

2143
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:10,850
但我们是唯一知道它的人
But we're the only people who know about it.

2144
02:02:11,150 --> 02:02:14,190
我把学术界的各种声音告诉过史汀生
I've told Stimson the various opinions of the community.

2145
02:02:14,190 --> 02:02:15,570
但你怎么说
But what's your opinion?

2146
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:18,060
一旦使用...
Once it's used...

2147
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,690
核战争  也许...
nuclear war, perhaps...

2148
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:23,070
所有战争...
all war...

2149
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:25,980
变得难以想象
becomes unthinkable.

2150
02:02:26,580 --> 02:02:28,700
直到有人造出更大的
Until somebody builds a bigger one.

2151
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:51,270
我以为他们会打电话
I thought they would call.

2152
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:53,010
这才5号
It's only the fifth.

2153
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:57,310
在日本  是6号了
In Japan, it's the sixth.

2154
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:10,990
夏洛特
Charlotte?

2155
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:14,700
打给格罗夫斯试试
Try Groves.

2156
02:03:16,210 --> 02:03:17,250
有消息吗
Anything?

2157
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:22,290
-夏洛特  -杜鲁门在广播
- Charlotte? - Truman's on the radio.

2158
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:26,040
16小时前
16 hours ago,

2159
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:28,300
一架美国战机
an American airplane

2160
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:31,930
在广岛投下一枚炸弹
dropped one bomb on Hiroshima,

2161
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:36,600
彻底摧毁了这座城市的军工生产能力
and destroyed its usefulness to the enemy.

2162
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:40,810
这枚炸弹的威力
The bomb has more power

2163
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:44,270
超过两万吨TNT
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

2164
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:48,490
这是一枚原子弹
It is an atomic bomb.

2165
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:55,950
这是对宇宙基本力量的运用
It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.

2166
02:03:58,090 --> 02:03:59,290
格罗夫斯在一号线
Groves on one.

2167
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:06,250
将军
General?

2168
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:09,170
我为你感到非常骄傲  为你领导的所有人
I'm very proud of you, and all of your people.

2169
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:10,500
一切顺利吗
It went alright?

2170
02:04:10,890 --> 02:04:13,510
据说是一次爆炸式的成功
Apparently it went with a tremendous bang.

2171
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:18,600
为此这里每个人都相当高兴
Well, everyone here is feeling reasonably good about it.

2172
02:04:20,110 --> 02:04:21,730
这一路过来不容易
It's been a long road.

2173
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:23,910
我认为我做过最明智的事
I think one of the wisest things I ever did

2174
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:26,820
就是选了你当洛斯阿拉莫斯的负责人
was when I selected the director of Los Alamos.

2175
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:33,860
我们花了这二十多亿美元
We have spent more than two billion dollars

2176
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:37,990
全押在历史上最大的科学赌博上
on the greatest scientific gamble in history,

2177
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:40,370
然后我们赢了
and we have won.

2178
02:04:44,760 --> 02:05:01,220
奥比  奥比  奥比
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

2179
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:09,580
全世界...
The world...

2180
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:13,250
将铭记这一天
will remember this day.

2181
02:06:31,870 --> 02:06:33,480
现在还无法
It's too soon to...

2182
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:36,000
现在还无法确定
It's too soon to determine

2183
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,320
投弹的最终结果
what the results of the bombing are.

2184
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:43,490
不过我敢打赌  日本人肯定受罪了
But I'll bet the Japanese didn't like it.

2185
02:07:03,710 --> 02:07:05,220
我非常自豪
I'm so proud.

2186
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:08,520
为你们的成就而自豪
So proud of what you have accomplished.

2187
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:19,110
可惜当时没来得及用它对付德国人
I just wish we had it in time to use against the Germans.

2188
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:09,760
奥本海默博士
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2189
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:12,140
奥本海默博士
Dr. Oppenheimer?

2190
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:14,350
照片不错
Nice picture.

2191
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:16,770
杜鲁门总统可以见你了
President Truman will see you now.

2192
02:09:31,170 --> 02:09:34,000
奥本海默博士  幸会
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an honor.

2193
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,960
-总统先生  -请坐
- Mr. President. - Please.

2194
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:36,960
谢谢
Thank you.

2195
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:39,080
伯恩斯部长
Secretary Byrnes.

2196
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:44,960
成为全世界最有名的人  感觉怎么样
How's it feel to be the most famous man in the world?

2197
02:09:45,470 --> 02:09:48,640
你拯救了很多美国人的生命
You helped save a lot of American lives.

2198
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:53,020
-我们在广岛的行动...  -还有长崎
- What we did at Hiroshima was... - And Nagasaki.

2199
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,520
当然
Obviously.

2200
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:59,070
因为你的发明  我们的士兵才安全归来了
Your invention let us bring our boys home.

2201
02:09:59,070 --> 02:10:02,700
不能说是我的发明
Well, it was hardly... my invention.

2202
02:10:02,700 --> 02:10:05,030
《时代》封面上的人是你
It was you on the cover of Time.

2203
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:11,460
吉姆说  你担心我们和苏联展开军备竞赛
Jim tells me you're concerned about an arms race with the Soviets.

2204
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:12,700
是的
Ah, yes, ah...

2205
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:15,120
这个...
Well, um...

2206
02:10:15,630 --> 02:10:20,040
现在是时候
it's that, uh, now is our chance to secure...

2207
02:10:20,890 --> 02:10:23,720
就原子能开展国际合作了
international cooperation on atomic energy,

2208
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:25,970
我担心
and-and-and I'm concerned...

2209
02:10:25,970 --> 02:10:29,100
你知道苏联什么时候能拥有原子弹吗
Do you know when the Soviets are gonna have the bomb?

2210
02:10:29,230 --> 02:10:30,730
我没法给出准确的...
I don't think I could give a...

2211
02:10:30,730 --> 02:10:31,760
永不
Never!

2212
02:10:32,980 --> 02:10:33,890
永不
Never.

2213
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:38,070
总统先生  苏联拥有优秀的物理学家
Mr. President, the Russians have good physicists,

2214
02:10:38,070 --> 02:10:40,780
-和丰富的资源  -还"丰富的"
- and, and abundant resources... - Abundant?

2215
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:41,610
没错
Yes.

2216
02:10:42,410 --> 02:10:44,360
我不这么想
I don't think so.

2217
02:10:44,530 --> 02:10:48,190
他们会倾尽全力...
Well, they'll put everything they have in...

2218
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:55,790
听说你要离开洛斯阿拉莫斯
I hear you're leaving Los Alamos.

2219
02:10:56,710 --> 02:10:58,210
该怎么处理它呢
What should we do with it?

2220
02:10:58,340 --> 02:11:00,040
还给原住民
Give it back to the Indians.

2221
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:10,630
奥本海默博士
Dr. Oppenheimer...

2222
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:14,220
如果你对苏联人的判断是对的
if what you say about the Soviets is true,

2223
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:18,850
我们必须扩建实验室  而不是把它关掉
we have to build up Los Alamos, not shut it down.

2224
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:23,690
总统先生
Mr. President...

2225
02:11:29,250 --> 02:11:33,030
我感觉自己的手上沾满鲜血
I feel that I have blood on my hands.

2226
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:56,220
你以为广岛
You think anyone in Hiroshima, or...

2227
02:11:56,810 --> 02:12:01,310
或长崎有人在乎原子弹是谁造的吗
Nagasaki, gives a shit who built the bomb?

2228
02:12:04,450 --> 02:12:06,560
他们在乎的是投弹的人
They care who dropped it.

2229
02:12:07,450 --> 02:12:08,650
是我
I did.

2230
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:13,780
广岛与你无关
Hiroshima isn't about you.

2231
02:12:20,170 --> 02:12:22,040
奥本海默博士
Dr. Oppenheimer.

2232
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:35,720
别再让那个爱哭鬼来了
Don't let that crybaby back in here!

2233
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:44,400
罗伯特明白了  内疚根本没用
Robert saw that hand-wringing got him nowhere.

2234
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:46,450
当我见到他时
By the time I met him,

2235
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:49,610
他已经完全接受了"原子弹之父"的声誉
he'd fully embraced his "Father of the Bomb" reputation

2236
02:12:50,120 --> 02:12:53,110
并利用自己的身份影响政策
and used his profile to influence policy.

2237
02:13:01,630 --> 02:13:03,300
博士  战后几年
Doctor, in the years following the war,

2238
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:05,510
你是否对美国的原子能政策
would you say that you exerted a great influence

2239
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:07,390
施加了重大影响
on the atomic policies of the USA?

2240
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:09,840
"重大"有点夸张了
I think "great" would be an overstatement.

2241
02:13:09,850 --> 02:13:12,060
是吗  就说说同位素问题吧
Really? I mean, look at the issue of isotopes.

2242
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:13,720
不正是你本人
Were you not personally responsible for

2243
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:15,980
扫清了所有反对同位素出口的意见吗
destroying all opposition to their export?

2244
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:19,440
造核武器还可能用到一瓶啤酒
...could use a bottle of beer in making atomic weapons.

2245
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:20,680
的确会用到
In fact, you do.

2246
02:13:20,730 --> 02:13:21,520
我是发言人
I was the spokesman,

2247
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:24,780
但科学家们的意见是一致的
but the opinion among scientists was unanimous.

2248
02:13:24,780 --> 02:13:26,570
随着麦卡锡主义崛起
All along, with McCarthy on the rise,

2249
02:13:26,570 --> 02:13:28,270
他明白自己有很多弱点
he knew he was vulnerable.

2250
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:32,570
他弟弟上了全国所有大学的黑名单
His brother was blacklisted by every university in the country.

2251
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:36,860
洛马尼茨沦落为铁路工人  去铺铁轨
Lomanitz wound up working the railroad, laying track.

2252
02:13:38,620 --> 02:13:41,030
薛瓦利埃被迫流亡
Chevalier went into exile.

2253
02:13:42,790 --> 02:13:45,300
但这都没有阻止罗伯特
But none of that stopped Robert

2254
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:48,050
推动总顾问委员会提案军备控制
from pushing the GAC to recommend arms control,

2255
02:13:48,050 --> 02:13:49,630
而不是研发氢弹
instead of the H-Bomb.

2256
02:13:51,340 --> 02:13:54,970
当杜鲁门否决提案时  他几近崩溃了
He was devastated when Truman rejected their recommendation.

2257
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:58,810
我太想念理查德了
I miss Richard more than I can bear.

2258
02:13:58,810 --> 02:14:00,560
我知道  露丝  我知道
I know, Ruth. I know.

2259
02:14:00,770 --> 02:14:03,970
幸好他看不到现在这番景象
I'm just glad he didn't live to see where this has all gone.

2260
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:10,160
寿星要来幸灾乐祸了
Here comes the birthday boy, to gloat...

2261
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:11,100
保重
Have fun.

2262
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:13,870
罗伯特  我儿子和他未婚妻
Robert, my son and his fiancée

2263
02:14:13,870 --> 02:14:16,490
非常想认识原子弹之父
are desperate to meet the father of the atomic bomb, so...

2264
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:17,450
你们好
Hello.

2265
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:26,750
现在不方便吗
Is this a bad time?

2266
02:14:27,670 --> 02:14:29,000
你觉得呢  路易斯
What do you think, Lewis?

2267
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:31,170
我觉得你肯定大受打击
Well, I think it must have been a blow for you.

2268
02:14:31,550 --> 02:14:32,710
是全世界大受打击
For the world.

2269
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:37,380
世界  福克斯和世界有什么关系
The world? What does Fuchs mean to the rest of the world?

2270
02:14:38,730 --> 02:14:39,760
福克斯
Fuchs?

2271
02:14:40,230 --> 02:14:41,470
克劳斯·福克斯
Klaus Fuchs?

2272
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:45,810
坏了  你还没听说
Oh dear. You haven't heard.

2273
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:50,690
克劳斯·福克斯  那个英国科学家
Klaus Fuchs, the British scientist

2274
02:14:50,690 --> 02:14:53,820
你把他分配进洛斯阿拉莫斯的爆炸团队
that you put onto the implosion team at Los Alamos.

2275
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:56,320
他其实是...
Turns out he was...

2276
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:59,450
他一直在为苏联传递情报
He was spying for the Soviets the whole time.

2277
02:14:59,450 --> 02:15:00,560
很遗憾
I'm sorry.

2278
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:09,010
福克斯的身份暴露后
After the truth about Fuchs came out,

2279
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:11,300
联调局升级了对他的监视措施
the FBI stepped up surveillance on him.

2280
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:13,380
他知道自己的电话被窃听
He knew his phone was tapped.

2281
02:15:14,010 --> 02:15:15,420
出行被跟踪
He was followed everywhere.

2282
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:17,930
垃圾被检查
His trash picked through.

2283
02:15:21,270 --> 02:15:23,890
但他依然坚持直抒己见
But he never stopped speaking his mind.

2284
02:15:24,020 --> 02:15:25,560
信念坚定
A man of conviction.

2285
02:15:25,690 --> 02:15:29,020
也许他认为  名誉可以保护自己
And maybe he thought fame could actually protect him.

2286
02:15:30,860 --> 02:15:33,690
艾森豪威尔上台后  他看到了一个新的机会
When Eisenhower took office, he saw one more chance.

2287
02:15:35,490 --> 02:15:36,360
他抓住了
He took it.

2288
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:40,200
可以把美国和苏联比作
America and Russia may be likened...

2289
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,210
一个瓶子里的两只蝎子
to two scorpions in a bottle.

2290
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:46,630
双方都能将对方置于死地
Each capable of killing the other,

2291
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:49,790
同时承担着丧命的风险
but only at the risk of his own life.

2292
02:15:50,010 --> 02:15:52,220
这项政策有很多方面
Now, there are various aspects of this policy...

2293
02:15:52,220 --> 02:15:54,090
很多科学家都指责我
A lot of scientists blame me,

2294
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:56,800
但我该怎么保护他呢
but how was I supposed to protect him?

2295
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:58,800
过于秘密  不便讨论
...are too secret for discussion.

2296
02:15:58,810 --> 02:16:00,810
坦率是唯一的出路
Candor is the only remedy.

2297
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:02,720
华盛顿的官员应该开始
Officials in Washington need to start

2298
02:16:02,730 --> 02:16:04,890
和美国人民坦诚相待了
leveling with the American people.

2299
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:08,360
这就是敌人压倒罗伯特的最后一根稻草
That was the last straw for Robert's enemies.

2300
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:11,150
所以他被迫失去了安全许可
So he had to lose his security clearance.

2301
02:16:11,150 --> 02:16:13,810
也失去了信誉
And with it, his credibility.

2302
02:16:13,990 --> 02:16:15,900
他们怎么能这么做
But how could they do it?

2303
02:16:16,110 --> 02:16:17,370
他可是战争英雄
He was a war hero.

2304
02:16:17,370 --> 02:16:19,320
他已经公开了自己的过去
He'd already told everyone about his past.

2305
02:16:19,330 --> 02:16:21,530
是波登挖出来的
Borden dredged it all up.

2306
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:24,660
波登怎么能拿到奥本海默的联调局档案
How could Borden get access to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

2307
02:16:24,670 --> 02:16:26,170
会不会是尼科斯
Could it have been Nichols?

2308
02:16:26,170 --> 02:16:28,240
不  我不认为他会这么做
No, I can't imagine he'd do that.

2309
02:16:28,590 --> 02:16:30,670
不论是谁  他都燃起了一场大火
Whoever did unleashed a firestorm

2310
02:16:30,670 --> 02:16:32,590
从白宫一路烧到
that burned a path in the White House,

2311
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:35,000
我在原子能委员会的办公桌前
right to my desk at the AEC.

2312
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:37,460
你看到他们的态度了  对吧
You seen 'em in there, right?

2313
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:40,550
我干了一辈子才终于有了今天
I've worked my whole life to get here.

2314
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:43,140
美国内阁成员
The cabinet of the United States of America,

2315
02:16:43,140 --> 02:16:45,350
现在  在全国人民面前
and now, in front of the entire country,

2316
02:16:45,350 --> 02:16:47,340
他们想把我赶回原来的位置
they want to put me back in my place.

2317
02:16:48,690 --> 02:16:50,720
卑微的卖鞋人
A lowly shoe salesman.

2318
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:53,140
路易斯  我们能赢
Lewis, we can win this thing.

2319
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:55,150
我们可以让参议院认识到
I think we can get the Senate to grasp

2320
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:57,780
你履行了职责  虽然很令人痛苦
that you did your duty, painful though it was.

2321
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:00,740
-希尔会对我们有利吗  -没问题
- Now, will Hill's testimony back us up? - Hill will be fine.

2322
02:17:00,740 --> 02:17:01,660
我和他不熟
Not really I know him,

2323
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:04,120
但他在芝加哥时是西拉德的手下
but he was one of Szilard's boys in Chicago.

2324
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:05,540
他们永远不会原谅罗伯特
And they'd never forgave Robert

2325
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:08,530
没有支持反对轰炸日本的请愿
for not supporting the petition against bombing Japan.

2326
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:12,950
这是投弹后31天拍摄的
This was taken 31 days after the bombing.

2327
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:18,540
方圆1.6千米之内  街上所有人
Virtually everyone in the streets, for nearly a mile around,

2328
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:22,130
基本都立即被烧焦了
was instantly and seriously burned.

2329
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:28,190
日本人说  很多人穿着有条纹的衣服
The Japanese spoke of people who wore striped clothing upon,

2330
02:17:28,190 --> 02:17:30,930
皮肤被烧成了条状
whom the skin was burned in stripes.

2331
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:34,060
很多人自以为很幸运
There were many who thought themselves lucky,

2332
02:17:34,530 --> 02:17:37,110
爬出被炸毁的房子
who climbed out of the ruins of their homes,

2333
02:17:37,110 --> 02:17:38,650
只受了轻伤
only slightly injured.

2334
02:17:40,070 --> 02:17:41,570
但他们还是死了
But they died anyway.

2335
02:17:42,530 --> 02:17:45,320
他们死于几天或几周之后
They died days, or weeks later,

2336
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:48,740
死于爆炸时释放出的
from radium-like rays emitted in great numbers

2337
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:51,120
大量类似镭辐射的射线
at the moment of the explosion.

2338
02:17:52,550 --> 02:17:54,420
你看过这篇垃圾报道了吗
Did you read this crap in the papers?

2339
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:56,380
有个英国物理学家说
A British physicist is saying

2340
02:17:56,380 --> 02:17:59,380
原子弹爆炸不是第二次世界大战的结束
the atomic bombings were not the last act of World War II,

2341
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:02,590
而是对苏冷战的开始
but the first act of this cold war with Russia.

2342
02:18:02,810 --> 02:18:04,140
哪个物理学家
Which physicist?

2343
02:18:04,140 --> 02:18:06,930
你应该认识  帕特里克·布莱克特
I think you knew him. Patrick Blackett.

2344
02:18:09,770 --> 02:18:11,100
他可能是对的
He may not be wrong.

2345
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:12,610
史汀生告诉我
Stimson is now telling me

2346
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:15,740
我们轰炸了一个已经战败的敌人
we bombed an enemy that was essentially defeated.

2347
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:18,400
罗伯特  你的影响力最大
Robert, you've all the influence now.

2348
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:20,270
拜托
Please,

2349
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:23,320
敦促他们让我继续研究氢弹
urge them to continue my research on the Super.

2350
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:25,370
我做不到  也不会做  爱德华
I neither can nor will, Edward.

2351
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:26,360
为什么
Why not?

2352
02:18:26,660 --> 02:18:28,830
我们不该把资源用在这里
It's not the right use of our resources.

2353
02:18:28,830 --> 02:18:30,620
你真的这么想吗
Is that what you really believe?

2354
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:35,790
J·罗伯特·奥本海默  谜一样的原子大师
J. Robert Oppenheimer? Sphinx-like guru of the atom?

2355
02:18:36,630 --> 02:18:38,540
没人了解你的信仰
Nobody knows what you believe.

2356
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:40,380
你自己知道吗
Do you?

2357
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:42,850
最后一次
One final time,

2358
02:18:42,850 --> 02:18:46,130
计划负责人J·罗伯特·奥本海默博士
our program director, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

2359
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:49,810
我希望  多年后
I hope that in years to come,

2360
02:18:49,810 --> 02:18:52,590
你们会骄傲地回想起自己在这里的工作
you will look back on your work here with pride.

2361
02:18:53,230 --> 02:18:57,730
但今天的主题不是骄傲  而是深切担忧
But today, that pride must be tempered with a profound concern.

2362
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:03,060
如果在交战世界的武器库中加入核武器
If atomic weapons are to be added to the arsenals of a warring world,

2363
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:05,450
那么人类总有一天
then the day will come

2364
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:08,950
将咒骂洛斯阿拉莫斯这个名字
when people will curse the name of Los Alamos.

2365
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:13,950
抱歉  上将
Sorry, Admiral.

2366
02:19:14,630 --> 02:19:16,240
路上买了这个
Stopped off to get this.

2367
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:18,660
似乎对我们有利
Seems pretty favorable.

2368
02:19:19,510 --> 02:19:21,920
是奥本海默  注释写的什么
There's Oppenheimer. What's the caption?

2369
02:19:22,550 --> 02:19:25,000
"J·罗伯特·奥本海默  施特劳斯与他开战
"J. Robert Oppenheimer. Strauss fought him...

2370
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:28,170
美国赢得胜利"
"and the US won."

2371
02:19:29,220 --> 02:19:30,220
这就够了
That'll work.

2372
02:19:30,220 --> 02:19:32,520
这是你那天说的话
Those were your words from the other day.

2373
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:34,010
我们需要转换策略
We needed to pivot.

2374
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:37,230
你怎么知道《时代》会这么写
But how would you know what Time Magazine was gonna write?

2375
02:19:37,230 --> 02:19:39,270
亨利·卢斯是我的朋友
Henry Luce is a friend.

2376
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:49,490
你坐在这  让我给你讲  该怎么达到目的
You sat here and let me tell you how it's done,

2377
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:51,900
而你早就开始布局了
but you've been far ahead all along.

2378
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:54,240
要在华盛顿生存下来
Survival in Washington.

2379
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:57,160
就要知道怎么达到目的
It's about knowing how to get things done.

2380
02:19:57,800 --> 02:19:58,660
对
Right.

2381
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:02,720
你是怎么说波登的来着
What was it you said about Borden?

2382
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:05,130
为什么要那么直接  让大家知道你是主使呢
Why get caught holding the knife yourself?

2383
02:20:07,050 --> 02:20:10,300
我现在觉得  波登是替你干脏活的
I'm beginning to think Borden was holding the knife for you.

2384
02:20:12,940 --> 02:20:13,810
现在关键在于
It's gonna come down to

2385
02:20:13,810 --> 02:20:17,140
波登对泰勒有多大影响
how much influence Borden's been able to exert on Teller.

2386
02:20:17,860 --> 02:20:19,480
我的话很好笑吗
Did I say something funny?

2387
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:20,690
只念叨波登
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden",

2388
02:20:20,690 --> 02:20:24,190
但我们都明白施特劳斯才是幕后主使
when we all know that it's Strauss.

2389
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:26,650
是路易斯把我带到普林斯顿的  吉蒂
Lewis brought me to Princeton, Kitty.

2390
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:29,370
然后你在国会面前羞辱了他
And then you humiliated him in front of Congress.

2391
02:20:29,370 --> 02:20:31,490
但比三明治有用
But more useful than a sandwich!

2392
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:35,950
我说得怎么样
How'd I do?

2393
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:39,240
好得有点过了  罗伯特
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

2394
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:40,840
那是六年前的事了
That was six years ago.

2395
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:44,420
他们伺机而动  睚眦必报
You know, they're truly vindictive, patient as saints.

2396
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:47,500
施特劳斯明确表示过他保持中立
Strauss has been perfectly clear that he is neutral.

2397
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:50,890
醒醒吧  就是施特劳斯干的
Wake up! It is Strauss!

2398
02:20:50,890 --> 02:20:53,260
从始至终都是施特劳斯  你比谁都清楚
It's always been Strauss, and you know it!

2399
02:20:53,810 --> 02:20:55,510
你为什么不和他斗
Why won't you fight him?

2400
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:02,440
不是尼科斯干的  也不是胡佛或者杜鲁门的手下
It wasn't Nichols, or Hoover, or one of Truman's guys.

2401
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:03,480
而是你
It was you.

2402
02:21:03,990 --> 02:21:05,400
是你把文件给了波登
You gave the file to Borden.

2403
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:07,070
你煽动他举报奥本海默
You set him on Oppenheimer.

2404
02:21:07,070 --> 02:21:08,470
-你说服了他  -波登
- You convinced him... - Borden...

2405
02:21:09,580 --> 02:21:11,980
根本不需要被说服
didn't take any convincing.

2406
02:21:12,040 --> 02:21:13,870
慢慢来  综合所有材料
Take your time, use the entire file.

2407
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:16,250
把结论写下来  再交给联调局
Write up your conclusions, send them to the FBI.

2408
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:18,370
材料是准备了一大堆
The material's obviously extensive,

2409
02:21:18,370 --> 02:21:20,710
但没什么新鲜料
but there's nothing new here.

2410
02:21:20,710 --> 02:21:22,370
所以才要你来写结论
Your conclusions will be.

2411
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,710
这样他们就必须回答
And they'll have to be answered.

2412
02:21:25,130 --> 02:21:27,050
让胡佛再转给麦卡锡
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

2413
02:21:27,050 --> 02:21:30,170
那个自吹自擂的笨蛋算计不过奥本海默
Oppenheimer's too slippery for that self-promoting clown.

2414
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:31,300
我和胡佛谈过了
I've talked it over with Hoover.

2415
02:21:31,300 --> 02:21:33,100
他会拖住麦卡锡
He'll hold McCarthy at bay

2416
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:35,300
同时你去面对原子能委员会
while you do this with the AEC.

2417
02:21:35,430 --> 02:21:37,390
-搞成庭审吗  -不  不能搞庭审
- Trial? - No, no trial.

2418
02:21:37,390 --> 02:21:40,350
你不能给奥本海默发挥的机会
You can't give Oppenheimer a platform.

2419
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:41,940
不能让他悲情殉道
You can't martyr him.

2420
02:21:42,360 --> 02:21:45,570
我们必须彻彻底底地让奥本海默信誉扫地
We need a systematic destruction of Oppenheimer's credibility,

2421
02:21:45,570 --> 02:21:49,610
这样他就再也不能插手国家安全事务
so he can never again speak on matters of national security.

2422
02:21:49,950 --> 02:21:51,070
然后呢
Then what?

2423
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:56,110
找个破旧的小房间  远离公众的视野
A shabby little room. Far from the limelight.

2424
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:03,710
一个简单的官僚程序
A simple bureaucratic procedure.

2425
02:22:03,710 --> 02:22:06,130
他的安全许可快要到期了
His Q clearance. It's up for renewal.

2426
02:22:06,130 --> 02:22:09,250
你把指控信发给联调局
You send your accusations to the FBI...

2427
02:22:11,220 --> 02:22:13,050
胡佛再转发给原子能委员会
Hoover sends them to the AEC.

2428
02:22:13,050 --> 02:22:14,630
你被迫行动
You're forced to act.

2429
02:22:14,850 --> 02:22:16,670
写一份诉状
You write up an indictment.

2430
02:22:16,970 --> 02:22:17,810
然后告诉奥本海默
You tell Oppenheimer

2431
02:22:17,810 --> 02:22:20,350
他的许可到期不续了
his security clearance is not being renewed.

2432
02:22:20,770 --> 02:22:22,560
但给他一次上诉的机会
But offer him the chance to appeal.

2433
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:25,110
如你所见  罗伯特  这份文件还没被签署
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.

2434
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:27,230
-我能留着吗  -不行
- May I keep this? - No.

2435
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:29,570
如果你选择上诉
If you do decide to appeal,

2436
02:22:29,570 --> 02:22:31,350
他们才必须给你一份复件
they'll have to send you a copy.

2437
02:22:31,490 --> 02:22:34,650
等他上诉  而且信我的  他肯定会
When he appeals, and trust me, he will,

2438
02:22:34,910 --> 02:22:36,490
我就指派一个委员会
I appoint a board.

2439
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:39,410
其中当然会有律师
They will, of course, have counsel.

2440
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:41,540
-检察官吗  -有  不叫检察官而已
- Prosecutor? - In all but name.

2441
02:22:41,540 --> 02:22:43,870
-是谁  -罗杰·罗伯
- Who? - Roger Robb.

2442
02:22:44,630 --> 02:22:47,880
罗伯将有权查阅奥本海默的档案
Robb will have security clearance to examine Oppenheimer's file.

2443
02:22:47,880 --> 02:22:51,130
格雷委员会也有  但奥本海默的律师没有
As will the Gray Board. Defense counsel will not.

2444
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:53,420
闭门听证会
A closed hearing.

2445
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:57,560
在你们对我的起诉书中提到的所谓审讯信息
The so-called interrogatory information in your indictment of me...

2446
02:22:57,560 --> 02:23:01,560
没有旁听席和记者  无需举证
No audience, no reporters, no burden of proof.

2447
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:03,140
无需举证
No burden of proof?

2448
02:23:04,650 --> 02:23:06,020
我们不是来定他罪的
We're not convicting.

2449
02:23:07,610 --> 02:23:09,140
我们是要搞垮他
We're just denying.

2450
02:23:14,410 --> 02:23:16,650
你怎么说的来着
What is it you said?

2451
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:20,820
这只是游戏规则而已
This is just how the game is played.

2452
02:23:21,330 --> 02:23:23,160
请恕我天真
Well, forgive my naivete.

2453
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:27,750
愚夫走到明处就被吞噬
Amateurs seek the sun, get eaten.

2454
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:32,010
智者待在暗处观兵不动
Power stays in the shadows.

2455
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:34,800
但您这次已经不能藏身于暗处了
But, sir, you're... you're out of the shadows now.

2456
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:37,380
没错  所以我们的计划必须成功
Yeah, that's why this has to work.

2457
02:23:39,810 --> 02:23:41,770
泰勒今早出庭
Teller's testifying this morning.

2458
02:23:41,770 --> 02:23:43,680
还算有利  然后呢
That'll help. And then...

2459
02:23:44,480 --> 02:23:45,690
希尔下午出庭
Hill is in the afternoon.

2460
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:47,430
希尔也会对我们有利
Hill is gonna help us too.

2461
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:53,310
如你所见  罗伯特  这份文件还没被签署
As you can see, Robert, it's not yet signed.

2462
02:23:53,660 --> 02:23:55,480
-我能留着吗  -不行
- May I keep this? - No.

2463
02:23:57,870 --> 02:23:59,740
如果你选择上诉
If you do decide to appeal,

2464
02:23:59,750 --> 02:24:02,740
他们才必须给你一份复件
then they'll have to send you a copy.

2465
02:24:06,250 --> 02:24:08,700
让我的司机送你  别和我客气
Take my car and driver, I insist.

2466
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:15,300
我要咨询我的律师  路易斯
I'll have to consult my lawyers, Lewis.

2467
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:18,050
没问题  但别太久
Of course. But don't take too long.

2468
02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:19,960
尼科斯那边我也拖不了太久
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

2469
02:24:26,270 --> 02:24:28,470
罗伯特  我很抱歉事情弄到这步田地
I'm sorry it's come to this, Robert.

2470
02:24:28,650 --> 02:24:29,810
本不该这样的
I think it's wrong.

2471
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:44,370
尼科斯希望我上诉
Nichols wants me to fight,

2472
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:46,410
这样他就能把一切记录在案
so he can get it all on the record.

2473
02:24:46,620 --> 02:24:48,420
施特劳斯想让我放弃上诉
Strauss wants me to walk away.

2474
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:51,170
施特劳斯吃准了你不会上诉
Strauss knows that you can't do that.

2475
02:24:51,170 --> 02:24:53,420
料定你会接受指控
You'd be accepting the charges.

2476
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:55,260
这样你就会丢掉工作
You'll lose your job.

2477
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:58,380
名誉扫地  我们连房子都保不住了
You will lose your reputation. We'll lose our house.

2478
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:00,170
罗伯特  我们必须抗争
Robert, we have to fight.

2479
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:05,680
作为原子能委员会的律师  我不能为你辩护
As AEC counsel, I can't represent you.

2480
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:07,380
我会找劳埃德·加里森
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

2481
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:08,810
他很出色
Oh, he's good.

2482
02:25:08,810 --> 02:25:09,440
是最出色的
The best,

2483
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:12,310
但我还是要提醒你
but I have to warn you.

2484
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:15,190
这不是公平斗争
This won't be a fair fight.

2485
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:18,200
1943年  你与鲍里斯·帕什的谈话中
During your interview with Boris Pash in 1943,

2486
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:19,910
是否提到过缩微胶卷
did you refer to microfilm?

2487
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:23,120
-没有  -11号文件  第1页  第3段
- No. - Tab 11, page one, paragraph three.

2488
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:24,790
你从没说过  "领事馆的人
You never said, "man of the consulate,

2489
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:26,620
用缩微胶卷的行家"
expert in the use of microfilm"?

2490
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:27,790
-抱歉  打断一下  -不
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry... - No.

2491
02:25:27,790 --> 02:25:29,920
我想知道罗伯先生引用的是哪份文件
I would like to know what document Mr. Robb is quoting from,

2492
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:32,000
能不能也给我们一份复件
and if we might be furnished with a copy.

2493
02:25:32,010 --> 02:25:33,960
这是保密文件  加里森先生
The document is classified, Mr. Garrison.

2494
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:36,260
我觉得我们应该用第一手信息
I think we should get back to firsthand information.

2495
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:37,590
这就是第一手信息
This is firsthand.

2496
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:39,000
怎么确认的  罗杰
How so, Roger?

2497
02:25:40,840 --> 02:25:42,750
那次谈话被录音了
There was a recording of the interview.

2498
02:25:47,230 --> 02:25:50,110
你让我的委托人冒着做伪证的风险事无巨细地回忆
You let my client sit here and potentially perjure himself,

2499
02:25:50,110 --> 02:25:52,480
但其实你手里一直有一份录音
and all this time, you had a recording?

2500
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:55,320
没人强迫你的委托人歪曲自己以前的言论
Nobody told your client to misrepresent his former answers.

2501
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:57,690
歪曲  那可是12年前说的话
Misrepresent? It was 12 years ago!

2502
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:58,900
我们可以听听录音吗
Can we hear this recording?

2503
02:25:58,910 --> 02:26:00,490
你没有听录音的权限  加里森先生
You don't have the clearance, Mr. Garrison.

2504
02:26:00,490 --> 02:26:02,410
那你读出来  它不就被记录在案了吗
But you're reading it into the record!

2505
02:26:02,410 --> 02:26:03,370
我来  我来
Please, please.

2506
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:07,320
请问我们的质询是要诱供还是找真相
Is this proceeding interested in entrapment or in truth?

2507
02:26:07,410 --> 02:26:10,280
如果是真相  那公开透明呢
If it's truth, where's the disclosure?

2508
02:26:10,460 --> 02:26:11,250
有证人吗
Where's the witness list?

2509
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:14,090
加里森先生  你很清楚我们这不是在法庭
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a trial, as you are well aware.

2510
02:26:14,090 --> 02:26:16,000
检方举证原则当下不适用
Evidentiary rules do not apply.

2511
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,050
我们面临的是国家安全问题
We are dealing with national security.

2512
02:26:18,050 --> 02:26:19,380
我知道  先生  但恕我直言
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

2513
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:20,590
我还是不能理解
I fail to see

2514
02:26:20,590 --> 02:26:23,510
为什么国家安全可以绕开庭审流程
how national security prevents the prosecution

2515
02:26:23,510 --> 02:26:26,060
连一份证人名单都不提供
from providing us with a list of witnesses!

2516
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:26,860
{\an8}也许我们该休会一下了
Perhaps we are in need of a brief recess.

2517
02:26:26,060 --> 02:26:28,350
先生们  我向你们保证
Gentlemen. You have my words.

2518
02:26:28,350 --> 02:26:31,100
如果你们说它是来自一份笔录  我接受
If you say they're from a transcript, then I'll accept it.

2519
02:26:31,100 --> 02:26:33,940
我都解释过了  那是我胡乱编造的
I've already explained I made up a cock-and-bull story.

2520
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:37,030
胡乱编造的故事怎么可以这么详实
And why would anyone make up such an elaborate story?

2521
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:38,640
因为我犯蠢了
Because I was an idiot.

2522
02:26:39,450 --> 02:26:40,690
为什么胡编
Why lie?

2523
02:26:40,780 --> 02:26:43,320
为的就是不把中间人
Well, clearly with the intention of not revealing

2524
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:45,080
公之于众
who the intermediary was.

2525
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:47,700
哈康·薛瓦利埃  你的那位共产党朋友
Your friend, Haakon Chevalier, the communist.

2526
02:26:47,830 --> 02:26:49,280
你们现在还是朋友么
Is he still your friend?

2527
02:26:49,830 --> 02:26:50,740
是
Yes.

2528
02:26:54,170 --> 02:26:56,330
拉比博士  感谢你能来
Dr. Rabi, thank you for coming.

2529
02:26:56,380 --> 02:26:58,420
你知道他们还传唤了谁吗
You know who else the prosecution has called?

2530
02:26:58,420 --> 02:27:00,580
泰勒  明摆着的
Teller, obviously.

2531
02:27:01,430 --> 02:27:02,790
他们肯定问了劳伦斯
They've asked Lawrence.

2532
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:03,680
他怎么说的
What did he say?

2533
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:05,550
他本来是想站在你这边的
He wasn't going to help them,

2534
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:07,340
-但是  -但是什么
- but... - But?

2535
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:08,940
施特劳斯告诉他
Strauss told him that

2536
02:27:08,940 --> 02:27:12,350
你和露丝·托尔曼有染好多年了
you and Ruth Tolman had been having an affair for years.

2537
02:27:12,350 --> 02:27:14,850
从你和他们一起住在帕萨迪纳时就开始了
The whole time you lived with them in Pasadena.

2538
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:16,440
他让劳伦斯相信
He convinced Lawrence that

2539
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:18,270
理查德就是因为这个伤心过世
Richard died of a broken heart.

2540
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:20,320
-无稽之谈  -哪里无稽
- That's absurd. - What part?

2541
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:21,650
伤心过世
A broken heart.

2542
02:27:22,150 --> 02:27:23,520
理查德根本就蒙在鼓里
Richard never found out.

2543
02:27:24,450 --> 02:27:26,070
劳伦斯也来作证吗
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

2544
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:27,200
我不确定
I don't know.

2545
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:32,580
拉比博士  你目前担任什么公职
Dr. Rabi, what governmental positions do you currently hold?

2546
02:27:32,710 --> 02:27:36,550
我接替了奥本海默博士
I am the chairman of the general advisory committee to the AEC,

2547
02:27:36,550 --> 02:27:38,550
担任原子能委员会的顾问委员会主席
succeeding Dr. Oppenheimer.

2548
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:41,000
你和奥本海默博士相识多久了
And how long have you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

2549
02:27:41,510 --> 02:27:43,050
1928年认识的
Since 1928.

2550
02:27:43,050 --> 02:27:45,640
我对他十分了解
I... I know him quite well.

2551
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:49,670
了解到足以评价他的人格品性吗
Well enough to speak to the bearing of his loyalty and character?

2552
02:27:49,890 --> 02:27:53,550
奥本海默博士品行正直
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man of upstanding character.

2553
02:27:53,980 --> 02:27:57,860
对于祖国和朋友  以及他的工作机构
And he is loyal to the United States, to his friends,

2554
02:27:57,860 --> 02:28:00,270
都无比的忠诚
to the institutions of which he is part.

2555
02:28:01,860 --> 02:28:02,690
吃吧
Eat.

2556
02:28:22,420 --> 02:28:23,290
刚才是谁
Who was that?

2557
02:28:23,470 --> 02:28:24,920
没谁  别担心
Nothing to worry about.

2558
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:29,720
苏联人试爆了原子弹后
After the Russian A-bomb test,

2559
02:28:29,720 --> 02:28:32,270
劳伦斯博士找你讨论过氢弹的事吗
did Dr. Lawrence come to see you about the hydrogen bomb?

2560
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:34,140
那你最好去问他
You'd be better off asking him.

2561
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:35,720
我自然要问
Well, I fully intend to.

2562
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,980
你认为奥本海默博士
Would you say that Dr. Oppenheimer

2563
02:28:37,980 --> 02:28:40,480
坚决反对氢弹么
was unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?

2564
02:28:40,490 --> 02:28:43,360
不  他认为开启氢弹这种核聚变项目
No, he, he thought that a fusion program

2565
02:28:43,360 --> 02:28:46,320
要以停止正在顺利进行的核裂变项目为代价
would come at the expense of our awfully good fission program.

2566
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,320
但事实并非如此
But that proved not to be the case.

2567
02:28:48,490 --> 02:28:50,280
事实上  二者可以共存
In the event, both could be done.

2568
02:28:50,410 --> 02:28:52,950
假设本委员会
Suppose that this board did not feel satisfied

2569
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:54,200
最终无法认定
that in his testimony here

2570
02:28:54,210 --> 02:28:57,240
奥本海默博士是诚实可信的
Dr. Oppenheimer had been wholly truthful,

2571
02:28:57,330 --> 02:28:59,500
你对他的清白与否持何观点呢
what would you say whether or not he should be cleared?

2572
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:01,800
一个完成了奥本海默这般成就的人
Why go through all this against a man

2573
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:03,840
我们为什么还要如此对待他
who has accomplished what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

2574
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:05,330
看看他的履历
Look at his record.

2575
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:08,010
我们拥有了原子弹  一系列原子弹
We have an A-bomb, and a whole series of it.

2576
02:29:08,010 --> 02:29:09,590
一系列氢弹
We have a whole series of super bombs.

2577
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:10,960
你们还苛求什么
What more do you want?

2578
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:12,550
来条美人鱼
Mermaids?

2579
02:29:13,180 --> 02:29:16,350
我和施特劳斯部长相识多年
But I've known Secretary Strauss for many years.

2580
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:19,890
我认为有必要提及
And I feel it a necessity to express the warm support

2581
02:29:20,110 --> 02:29:22,650
路易斯对科学和科学家的暖心支持
for science and scientists Lewis has shown.

2582
02:29:22,650 --> 02:29:25,530
没什么急事的话我们先午休吧
We'll break now. Unless there's any immediate business.

2583
02:29:25,530 --> 02:29:28,620
议员先生  我想再次提请
Senator, I'd like to once again request

2584
02:29:28,660 --> 02:29:31,330
一份证人名单
that we're furnished with a list of witnesses.

2585
02:29:31,330 --> 02:29:32,830
我要提醒候选人
And I will remind the nominee

2586
02:29:32,830 --> 02:29:35,920
我们一般不会提前知晓证人的信息
that we don't always have that information in advance.

2587
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:38,760
我们确认的是希尔博士午饭后会出庭
We do know that Dr. Hill will be here after lunch.

2588
02:29:38,970 --> 02:29:41,800
主席先生  我们下一位证人劳伦斯博士
Mr. Chairman, our next scheduled witness, Dr. Lawrence,

2589
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:44,930
可能是由于结肠炎的原因不能来了
has apparently come down with colitis.

2590
02:29:47,970 --> 02:29:50,520
所以我们递补传唤了威廉·波登
So we'll proceed with William Borden instead.

2591
02:29:51,230 --> 02:29:53,810
波登先生  欢迎前来  请坐
Mr. Borden, welcome. Please take a seat.

2592
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:56,440
波登先生
Mr. Borden,

2593
02:29:57,690 --> 02:30:00,280
在你调查奥本海默博士期间
during your investigation into Dr. Oppenheimer,

2594
02:30:00,280 --> 02:30:02,400
是否得出了最终结论
did you reach certain conclusions?

2595
02:30:02,610 --> 02:30:04,320
-是的  -你是否以信件的形式
- I did. - And did there come a time

2596
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:06,280
把调查结果寄给了
when you expressed those conclusions in a letter

2597
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:09,870
联邦调查局局长J·埃德加·胡佛先生
to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation?

2598
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:10,500
是的
That is correct.

2599
02:30:10,500 --> 02:30:11,450
写信之前
Prior to the writing of the letter,

2600
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:13,120
你是否和任何原子能委员会的人讨论过
did you discuss the writing of the letter

2601
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:15,830
写信本身这件事
with anybody attached to the Atomic Energy Commission?

2602
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:17,090
-从没有  -很好
- I did not. - Excellent.

2603
02:30:17,090 --> 02:30:19,090
-你拿到信的复件了吗  -就在我面前
- Do you have a copy of the letter? - I have one in front of me.

2604
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:21,670
能请你诵读一下吗
Would you please be so kind as to read it, sir?

2605
02:30:22,590 --> 02:30:25,470
"尊敬的胡佛先生  我写这封信是为了阐述..."
"Dear Mr. Hoover, the purpose of this letter is to state...

2606
02:30:25,470 --> 02:30:27,810
抱歉  我能问下吗
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, if I could have...

2607
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:29,510
为什么要打断他
What is the purpose of the delay?

2608
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,180
他不过是念他写的信
He's simply going to read the letter.

2609
02:30:32,020 --> 02:30:34,690
主席先生  我是第一次见到这封信
Mr. Chairman, this is the first I've seen of this letter.

2610
02:30:34,810 --> 02:30:37,730
光扫一眼就看到很多说法  其中至少有一条
And I see statements here, at least one,

2611
02:30:37,730 --> 02:30:38,570
是那种我觉得在座的各位
of a kind that I don't think

2612
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:40,190
都不会愿意写入会议记录的
anyone would like to see go into the record.

2613
02:30:40,190 --> 02:30:42,900
这些指控都是之前没有的
These are accusations that have not previously been made,

2614
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:44,780
没有一个来自尼科斯的起诉书
that are not part of the indictment from Nichols.

2615
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:47,370
不应该在这里讨论的指控
Accusations of a kind that I don't think belong here.

2616
02:30:47,370 --> 02:30:49,490
信是证人主动写的
The witness wrote this letter on his own initiative,

2617
02:30:49,490 --> 02:30:52,000
列举的证据也都是本委员会之前就知道的
laying out evidence that has already been before the board.

2618
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,580
他的结论是有效力的证词
His conclusions are valid testimony,

2619
02:30:53,580 --> 02:30:56,880
就像奥本海默博士的朋友们做出的正面评价一样
just like the positive conclusions of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

2620
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:58,500
有正面就有负面
It cuts both ways.

2621
02:30:58,590 --> 02:31:00,880
控方律师持有这封信有多久了
How long has counsel been in possession of this letter?

2622
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:03,630
我并不认为我需要接受你的盘问
I don't think I should be subject to cross-examination by you,

2623
02:31:03,630 --> 02:31:04,380
加里森先生
Mr. Garrison.

2624
02:31:04,380 --> 02:31:07,640
加里森先生  鉴于委员会成员皆已读过这封信
Mr. Garrison, given that we on the board have all read the letter,

2625
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:09,680
把它记录在案不好吗
wouldn't it be better to have it in the record?

2626
02:31:10,810 --> 02:31:11,970
我们继续
Let's proceed.

2627
02:31:13,890 --> 02:31:15,140
"尊敬的胡佛先生
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

2628
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:18,690
我写这封信是为了阐述我的以下意见
"the purpose of this letter is to state my opinion,

2629
02:31:18,730 --> 02:31:22,480
基于数年对于现有机密证据的研究
"based upon years of study of the available classified evidence,

2630
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:25,070
我认为J·罗伯特·奥本海默
"that, more probably than not,

2631
02:31:25,070 --> 02:31:29,320
有可能是一名苏联间谍
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union.

2632
02:31:30,030 --> 02:31:32,540
证据列出如下
"The following conclusions are justified.

2633
02:31:32,540 --> 02:31:37,040
一  1929年至1942年间
"One, between 1929 and 1942, more probably than not,

2634
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:40,710
J·罗伯特·奥本海默有可能是一个坚定的共产主义者
"J. Robert Oppenheimer was a sufficiently hardened communist

2635
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:43,420
并因此自愿为苏联提供情报
"that he volunteered information to the Soviets.

2636
02:31:43,420 --> 02:31:45,590
二  他有可能
"Two, more probably than not,

2637
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:49,470
自那时起就作为一名间谍存在
"he has since been functioning as an espionage agent.

2638
02:31:50,010 --> 02:31:50,760
三
"Three.

2639
02:31:51,260 --> 02:31:55,100
他有可能受苏联上级指示
"More probably than not, he has since acted under a Soviet directive

2640
02:31:55,100 --> 02:31:58,100
自那时起影响美国的军事政策"
"in influencing United States military policy."

2641
02:31:58,100 --> 02:32:00,610
-对不起  罗伯特  -"原子能  情报及..."
- I'm sorry, Robert. - "Atomic energy, intelligence and..."

2642
02:32:00,610 --> 02:32:05,280
到底有没有人能说出事情的真相
Is anyone ever going to tell the truth about what's happening here?

2643
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:08,490
现在请大卫·希尔博士发言
We will now hear from Dr. David Hill.

2644
02:32:18,580 --> 02:32:21,710
希尔博士  请发表你的看法
Dr. Hill, would you care to make a statement?

2645
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:24,630
谢谢
Thank you.

2646
02:32:25,010 --> 02:32:28,930
我受邀为路易斯·施特劳斯作证
I've been asked to testify about Lewis Strauss,

2647
02:32:28,930 --> 02:32:31,050
他已在政府部门
a man who has given years of service

2648
02:32:31,050 --> 02:32:33,760
久居高位
in high positions of government,

2649
02:32:33,970 --> 02:32:38,940
他素来有认真  勤奋  聪慧之名
and who is known to be earnest, hard-working, and intelligent.

2650
02:32:40,100 --> 02:32:42,270
以下完全是我本人的真实想法
The views I have to express are my own,

2651
02:32:42,610 --> 02:32:46,190
我相信我要说的会帮助诸位了解
but I believe that much I have to say will help to indicate why

2652
02:32:46,990 --> 02:32:51,410
我国绝大多数科学家希望施特劳斯先生
most of the scientists in this country would prefer to see Mr. Strauss

2653
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:54,200
彻底离开政府部门的原因
completely out of government.

2654
02:32:56,790 --> 02:33:00,040
您指的是某些科学家针对施特劳斯先生的敌意
You're referring to the hostility of certain scientists,

2655
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:03,750
只因为他在奥本海默事件中
directed toward Mr. Strauss, because of his commitment to security,

2656
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:06,760
选择了国家安全
as demonstrated in the Oppenheimer affair?

2657
02:33:09,470 --> 02:33:10,260
不是
No.

2658
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:13,050
是因为他对奥本海默博士本人
Because of the personal vindictiveness

2659
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:15,680
表现出的报复心理
he demonstrated against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2660
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:20,340
肃静  肃静
Order! Order!

2661
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:24,360
在这个国家的大多数科学家看来
It appears to most scientists around this country

2662
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:28,280
罗伯特·奥本海默现在正遭受抨击  历经磨难
that Robert Oppenheimer is now being pilloried,

2663
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:32,860
只是因为他表达了自己的诚实观点
and put through an ordeal, because he expressed his honest opinions.

2664
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:36,280
布什博士  我认为这场听证会只是
Dr. Bush, I thought I was performing a service to my country

2665
02:33:36,290 --> 02:33:40,160
-我在尽对国家的义务  -本国不该有任何委员会
- when hearing this case. - No board, in this country,

2666
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:41,920
可以只是因为他表达强烈意见
should sit in judgment of a man

2667
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:44,380
就对他进行审判
because he expressed his strong opinions.

2668
02:33:44,380 --> 02:33:46,960
如果要进行这种审判  先审判我吧
If you want to try that case, you should try me.

2669
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:50,760
不好意思  先生们  我可能太激动了
Excuse me, gentlemen, if I've... become stirred.

2670
02:33:51,550 --> 02:33:52,590
但我就是很激动
But I am.

2671
02:33:52,970 --> 02:33:54,510
希尔博士  我们已经知道
Dr. Hill, we've already heard that

2672
02:33:54,510 --> 02:33:56,930
施特劳斯先生并没有提起
Mr. Strauss did not bring the charges,

2673
02:33:56,930 --> 02:34:00,060
或者参与到对奥本海默博士的听证会中
or participate in the hearings against Dr. Oppenheimer.

2674
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:02,060
奥本海默事件...
The Oppenheimer matter was...

2675
02:34:02,690 --> 02:34:05,650
很大程度上是由路易斯·施特劳斯
initiated, and carried through, largely through

2676
02:34:05,650 --> 02:34:07,820
对奥本海默的敌意引发并进行下去的
the animus of Lewis Strauss.

2677
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:11,690
奥本海默把施特劳斯关于向挪威出口同位素的立场
Oppenheimer made mincemeat out of Strauss's position

2678
02:34:11,700 --> 02:34:13,910
驳得体无完肤
on the shipments of isotopes to Norway,

2679
02:34:13,910 --> 02:34:17,580
施特劳斯一直没有原谅这场公开的奇耻大辱
and Strauss never forgave him this public humiliation.

2680
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:19,410
他们之间的另一个冲突
Another controversy between them

2681
02:34:19,410 --> 02:34:21,540
是他们对于氢弹
centered around their differences in judgment

2682
02:34:21,540 --> 02:34:24,790
在国防方面作用的意见分歧
on how the H-bomb would contribute to national security.

2683
02:34:24,790 --> 02:34:28,290
施特劳斯试图利用人员安全系统
Strauss turned to the personnel security system in order to

2684
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:30,800
以压制奥本海默的影响力
destroy Oppenheimer's effectiveness,

2685
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:33,800
施特劳斯找到了一些有野心的人
and Strauss was able to find a few ambitious men

2686
02:34:33,930 --> 02:34:37,800
他们同样反对奥本海默的观点  并且嫉妒他
who also disagreed with Oppenheimer's positions and envied him

2687
02:34:37,810 --> 02:34:40,100
嫉妒他在政界的声誉
his prestige in government circles.

2688
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:42,310
我一直认为  到现在仍然认为
I've always assumed, and still assume,

2689
02:34:42,310 --> 02:34:44,390
他忠于美国
that he is loyal to the United States.

2690
02:34:44,850 --> 02:34:46,520
我坚信  也会继续坚信这一点
I believe this, and I shall believe it,

2691
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:49,230
除非我看到非常确凿的反驳证据
until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.

2692
02:34:49,480 --> 02:34:53,570
你认为奥本海默博士是安全风险吗
Do you or do you not believe that Dr. Oppenheimer is a security risk?

2693
02:34:57,070 --> 02:35:00,490
有很多次  我观察到奥本海默博士
In a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act in a way

2694
02:35:00,490 --> 02:35:03,830
以一种我很难理解的方式行事
which was, to me, exceedingly hard to understand.

2695
02:35:03,830 --> 02:35:06,460
我在很多问题上完全不同意他的观点
I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues,

2696
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:09,880
他的行为对我来说其实是迷惑而混乱的
and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated.

2697
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:12,380
因此  我希望看到
To this extent, I feel I want to see

2698
02:35:12,380 --> 02:35:14,800
这个国家的核心利益
the vital interests of this country

2699
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:18,800
掌握在我更加了解  因此也更加信任的人手中
in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more.

2700
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:21,100
-谢谢你  博士  -谢谢
- Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you.

2701
02:35:25,310 --> 02:35:26,140
对不起
I'm sorry.

2702
02:35:29,060 --> 02:35:31,230
你居然跟他握手了
You shook his fucking hand!?

2703
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:34,150
要是我就啐他一脸
I would have spit in his face.

2704
02:35:34,150 --> 02:35:36,320
委员会大概不会想看到那种场景
I'm not sure the Board would have appreciated that.

2705
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:37,950
对你来说不够绅士吗
Is it not gentlemanly enough for you?

2706
02:35:37,950 --> 02:35:40,870
我倒觉得你们就是太绅士了
I think you're all being too goddamn gentlemanly.

2707
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:42,870
格雷肯定知道罗伯在做什么
Gray must see what Robb is doing.

2708
02:35:42,870 --> 02:35:44,910
为什么不阻止他
Why doesn't he just shut him down?

2709
02:35:44,910 --> 02:35:47,250
还有你  居然跟泰勒握手
And you, shaking Teller's hand.

2710
02:35:47,250 --> 02:35:50,670
你别再沉迷于你的殉道者角色了
You need to stop playing the martyr.

2711
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:53,710
按照现行的原子能委员会准则
Under the current AEC guidelines,

2712
02:35:53,710 --> 02:35:56,130
你今天还会给奥本海默博士发放安全许可吗
would you clear Dr. Oppenheimer today?

2713
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:06,850
根据我对《原子能法》的理解
Under my interpretation of the Atomic Energy Act,

2714
02:36:06,850 --> 02:36:11,610
虽然1942年我聘请奥本海默博士时这法案还不存在
which did not exist when I hired Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942,

2715
02:36:12,780 --> 02:36:16,070
但如果我今天是委员会成员
I would not clear him today

2716
02:36:16,490 --> 02:36:18,280
不会批准他的安全许可
if I were on the commission.

2717
02:36:18,530 --> 02:36:19,860
好的  谢谢你  将军  问话结束了
Good. Thank you, General. That is all.

2718
02:36:19,870 --> 02:36:22,240
但我也不会批准其中任何人的
But I don't think I'd clear any of those guys.

2719
02:36:22,580 --> 02:36:23,410
结束了
That's all.

2720
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:29,460
奥本海默博士与克劳斯·福克斯的选任
Dr. Oppenheimer had no responsibility in the selection

2721
02:36:29,460 --> 02:36:31,500
以及安全许可没有任何关系  对吗
or the clearance of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

2722
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:32,840
对的  完全没有
No. None at all.

2723
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:34,300
你也不想让委员会觉得
And you wouldn't want to leave this board

2724
02:36:34,300 --> 02:36:36,380
你今天所说的任何内容是在质疑
with any suggestion today that

2725
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:39,130
他在洛斯阿拉莫斯工作期间
you're here questioning his basic loyalty to the United States

2726
02:36:39,130 --> 02:36:41,090
对美国的忠诚  对吧
in the operation of Los Alamos?

2727
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:42,050
绝对没有
By no means.

2728
02:36:42,050 --> 02:36:45,430
我希望我没有给任何人留下一丝这种印象
I hope I didn't lead anyone to believe otherwise for an instant.

2729
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:47,640
谢谢你  将军
Thank you, General.

2730
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:08,410
-好了  我们别让他们等了  -她会来的
- Okay. We shouldn't keep them waiting. - She'll be here.

2731
02:37:08,910 --> 02:37:10,790
你真的希望她出席吗
Do you even want her here?

2732
02:37:10,790 --> 02:37:13,250
只有傻瓜或者不成熟的人
Only a fool or an adolescent presumes

2733
02:37:13,250 --> 02:37:14,840
才会自认为了解别人的伴侣关系
to know someone else's relationship,

2734
02:37:14,850 --> 02:37:17,300
你应该都不是吧  劳埃德
and you're neither, Lloyd.

2735
02:37:19,590 --> 02:37:22,510
吉蒂和我都是成年人
Kitty and I are grown-ups.

2736
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:25,310
我们共同经历过考验
We've walked through fire together.

2737
02:37:26,100 --> 02:37:27,310
她可以的
She'll do fine.

2738
02:37:28,430 --> 02:37:32,310
你对共产主义的看法是赞成  反对还是中立
Would you describe your views on communism as pro, anti, neutral?

2739
02:37:32,310 --> 02:37:33,440
非常反对
Very strongly against.

2740
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:36,400
我跟共产主义没有任何关系  从...
I've had nothing to do with communism in, since...

2741
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:38,530
从1936年...
since 1936. Since...

2742
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:41,280
在我遇见罗伯特之前
Since before I met Robert.

2743
02:37:43,030 --> 02:37:43,870
我的问话结束
That's all.

2744
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:47,910
记录表明  奥本海默没有受到格雷委员会
The record demonstrates that Oppenheimer was not interrogated

2745
02:37:47,910 --> 02:37:51,330
公正无私的讯问
by impartial and disinterested counsel for the Gray Board.

2746
02:37:51,330 --> 02:37:53,620
检察官使用了所有的
He was interrogated by a prosecutor who used

2747
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:56,340
法律范围内允许的审讯技巧
all the tricks of a rather ingenious legal background.

2748
02:37:56,340 --> 02:38:00,760
你在指控格雷委员会进行的是一场检控
You are charging now that the Gray Board permitted a prosecution.

2749
02:38:01,220 --> 02:38:02,680
如果我是格雷委员会的一员
If I were on the Gray Board,

2750
02:38:03,340 --> 02:38:05,340
我会对实际作为检方的人
I would have protested against the tactics

2751
02:38:05,350 --> 02:38:08,310
使用的手段提出异议
of the man who served in fact as the prosecuting counsel.

2752
02:38:08,310 --> 02:38:10,270
他并不是委员会指派的人
A man appointed not by the Board,

2753
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:13,310
而是路易斯·施特劳斯指派的
but by Lewis Strauss.

2754
02:38:15,480 --> 02:38:16,520
他是谁
Who was this?

2755
02:38:18,110 --> 02:38:18,940
不好意思
I'm sorry?

2756
02:38:19,820 --> 02:38:20,860
他是谁
Who was this?

2757
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:22,570
罗杰·罗伯
Roger Robb.

2758
02:38:22,990 --> 02:38:24,450
奥本海默夫人
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

2759
02:38:28,990 --> 02:38:31,330
你有没有共产党员卡片
Did you have a Communist Party membership card?

2760
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:35,170
我...我不确定
I'm... I'm not sure.

2761
02:38:35,170 --> 02:38:36,130
不确定
Not sure?

2762
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:56,560
入党的途径想必是需要寄一些钱过去
I mean, presumably, the act of joining the party

2763
02:38:56,560 --> 02:38:59,770
然后收到一张卡片  没错吧
required sending some money and receiving a card, no?

2764
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:10,990
对不起
Sorry.

2765
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,040
没错
Yes.

2766
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:18,960
只是这件事过去太久太久了  不是吗  罗伯先生
It's just, it was all so very long ago, Mr. Robb, wasn't it?

2767
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,340
-也不是吧  -久到让人忘记了
- Not really. - Long enough to have forgotten.

2768
02:39:20,340 --> 02:39:22,090
你把卡片还回去了吗  还是撕掉了
Did you return the card, or rip it up?

2769
02:39:22,090 --> 02:39:23,670
你说的是我都不记得有过的那张卡片吗
The card whose existence I've forgotten?

2770
02:39:23,670 --> 02:39:26,840
-你的共产党员卡吗  -没有一点印象
- Your Communist Party membership card? - Haven't the slightest idea.

2771
02:39:29,850 --> 02:39:34,180
你能区分苏联共产主义和共产主义吗
Can a distinction be made between Soviet communism and communism?

2772
02:39:34,350 --> 02:39:35,560
在我还是党员时
In the days when I was a member,

2773
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:37,650
我认为二者是完全不同的
I thought they were definitely two things.

2774
02:39:37,650 --> 02:39:40,270
我认为美国共产党
I thought that the Communist Party of the United States

2775
02:39:40,270 --> 02:39:42,480
关心的是国内的问题
was concerned with our domestic problems.

2776
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:44,110
我现在不相信这点了
I now no longer believe this.

2777
02:39:44,110 --> 02:39:45,280
我认为一切都联系了起来
I believe the whole thing's linked together

2778
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:46,570
向全世界扩散开去
and spread all over the world,

2779
02:39:46,570 --> 02:39:50,700
我16年前退党以后  一直坚信这一点
and I have believed this since I left the party 16 years ago.

2780
02:39:50,700 --> 02:39:53,580
-但是...  -17年前  我记错了
- But... - 17 years ago. My mistake.

2781
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:55,370
-但你...  -抱歉  是18
- But you... - Sorry, 18.

2782
02:39:56,460 --> 02:39:58,000
18年前
18 years ago.

2783
02:39:59,130 --> 02:40:01,670
你是否清楚你的丈夫直到1942年
Are you familiar with the fact your husband was making contributions

2784
02:40:01,670 --> 02:40:04,420
都还在为西班牙内战出力
to the Spanish Civil War as late as 1942?

2785
02:40:04,420 --> 02:40:06,590
我知道罗伯特会时不时往外汇款
I knew that Robert gave money from time to time.

2786
02:40:06,590 --> 02:40:09,300
你知道这些钱会流入共产党的渠道吗
Did you know this money was going into Communist Party channels?

2787
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:11,390
-你是说经过吗  -你说什么
- Don't you mean through? - Pardon?

2788
02:40:11,390 --> 02:40:14,560
你应该是想说钱会经过共产党的渠道  对吧
I think you mean through Communist Party channels, don't you?

2789
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:15,640
-对  -是吗
- Yes. - Yes?

2790
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:17,560
-是的  -好的
- Yes. - Yes.

2791
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:20,810
那这是否意味着直至1942年
Then would it be fair to say that this meant that by 1942,

2792
02:40:20,810 --> 02:40:21,900
你的丈夫还没有停止
your husband had not stopped

2793
02:40:21,900 --> 02:40:23,980
与共产党的瓜葛呢
having anything to do with the Communist Party?

2794
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:26,360
你不用只回答是或否
You don't have to answer that yes or no,

2795
02:40:26,360 --> 02:40:27,820
你可以按照你的想法回答
you can answer that any way you wish.

2796
02:40:27,820 --> 02:40:30,910
我知道  谢谢  你的提问有问题
I know that, thank you. It's your question.

2797
02:40:31,660 --> 02:40:33,030
表述得不太到位
It's not properly phrased.

2798
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:34,660
-你知道我想问什么吗  -我知道
- Do you understand what I'm getting at? - I do.

2799
02:40:34,660 --> 02:40:35,450
那为什么不按照那个来回答呢
Then why don't you answer it that way?

2800
02:40:35,450 --> 02:40:37,500
因为我不喜欢你的措辞
Because I don't like your phrase,

2801
02:40:37,660 --> 02:40:39,540
"与共产党的瓜葛"
"having anything to do with the Communist Party,"

2802
02:40:39,540 --> 02:40:41,080
因为罗伯特和共产党
because Robert never had anything to do

2803
02:40:41,080 --> 02:40:42,920
从来没有任何关系
with the Communist Party as such.

2804
02:40:42,920 --> 02:40:45,300
我知道他给西班牙难民捐款
I know he gave money to Spanish refugees.

2805
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:48,550
我知道他对共产主义思想很感兴趣
I know he took an intellectual interest in communist ideas.

2806
02:40:48,550 --> 02:40:50,430
有两种共产主义者吗
Are there two types of communists?

2807
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:53,300
思想共产主义者  以及你们普通的共产主义者
Intellectual communists, and your plain old regular commie?

2808
02:40:54,510 --> 02:40:56,220
我回答不了这个问题
I couldn't answer that one.

2809
02:40:57,230 --> 02:40:58,480
我也不能
I couldn't either.

2810
02:41:05,610 --> 02:41:06,610
晚安
Good evening.

2811
02:41:06,900 --> 02:41:08,320
罗伯特  你赢不了
Robert, you can't win this thing.

2812
02:41:08,320 --> 02:41:10,700
这是一个有着预定结果的袋鼠法庭[无视公平正义和司法程序]It's a kangaroo court with a predetermined outcome.

2813
02:41:10,700 --> 02:41:12,490
为什么还要让自己经历这些呢
Why put yourself through more of it?

2814
02:41:13,160 --> 02:41:14,780
我有我的原因
I have my reasons.

2815
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:16,950
好吧
Alright.

2816
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:18,540
晚安
Good night.

2817
02:41:23,250 --> 02:41:24,880
他说得有道理
He has a point.

2818
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:28,630
-我觉得你不理解  阿尔伯特  -是吗
- I'm not sure you understand, Albert. - No?

2819
02:41:29,630 --> 02:41:32,180
我离开了我的祖国  再没回去
I left my country, never to return.

2820
02:41:33,140 --> 02:41:34,970
你对你的祖国尽职尽责
You served your country well.

2821
02:41:35,510 --> 02:41:38,100
如果这就是她给你的回报...
If this is the reward she offers you, then...

2822
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:41,520
或许你应该考虑放弃她
perhaps you should turn your back on her.

2823
02:41:42,520 --> 02:41:44,560
不巧  我非常热爱这个国家
Damn it, I happen to love this country.

2824
02:41:45,270 --> 02:41:47,320
那就让他们见鬼去吧
Then tell them to go to hell.

2825
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:51,650
好了  再也没有什么确认听证会
Interestingly enough, this is no longer a confirmation hearing.

2826
02:41:51,660 --> 02:41:53,110
现在  这就是审判
It's now a trial...

2827
02:41:53,700 --> 02:41:54,990
关于一场审判的审判
about a trial!

2828
02:41:54,990 --> 02:41:56,450
我的老天啊
For god's sakes!

2829
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:59,250
情况不太妙  他告诉大家是你发起的听证会
It's not good he's telling everyone you initiated the hearings.

2830
02:41:59,250 --> 02:42:01,330
他什么都没法证明
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

2831
02:42:01,330 --> 02:42:04,920
他绝对无法证明是我把文件给了波登
He certainly can't prove that I gave the file to Borden.

2832
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:07,960
我们不是在法庭  先生  无需举证
We're not in court, sir. There's no burden of proof.

2833
02:42:08,170 --> 02:42:09,960
没错  他们不是来定罪的
Right, they're not convicting.

2834
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:12,380
是要搞垮我
They're just denying.

2835
02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:15,680
希尔为什么会来诋毁我  他是出于什么目的
Why would Hill come here to tear me down? What's his angle?

2836
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:17,970
见义当为需要理由吗
Do people need a reason to do the right thing?

2837
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:20,470
-在他看来  -我告诉过你
- As he sees it. - I told you.

2838
02:42:20,480 --> 02:42:22,940
从第一次见面起  奥本海默就一直怂恿
Oppenheimer's been poisoning the scientists against me

2839
02:42:22,940 --> 02:42:24,650
科学家们跟我对着干
right from that first meeting.

2840
02:42:24,650 --> 02:42:27,400
我不知道那天奥本海默对他说了什么
I don't know what Oppenheimer said to him that day,

2841
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:30,610
但爱因斯坦甚至都不愿拿正眼看我
but Einstein wouldn't even meet my eye.

2842
02:42:32,150 --> 02:42:34,360
奥本海默很擅长操纵同僚
Oppenheimer knows how to manipulate his own.

2843
02:42:34,570 --> 02:42:36,030
在洛斯阿拉莫斯
At Los Alamos,

2844
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:38,530
他就利用过那些科学家的天真
he preyed on the naivete of scientists

2845
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:41,080
他们以为有权决定我们如何使用其研究成果
who thought they get a say in how we use their work.

2846
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:43,540
他们绝对想不到  他本人其实那样幼稚无知
They'll never think he was that naive himself.

2847
02:42:43,830 --> 02:42:47,330
博士  在氢弹研究的过程中
Doctor, during your work on the hydrogen bomb,

2848
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:50,260
你是否曾因道义上的不安而止步不前
were you... deterred by any moral qualms?

2849
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:52,090
是的  当然
Yes, of course.

2850
02:42:52,340 --> 02:42:54,130
但你还是继续研究下去了  对不对
But you still got on with your work, didn't you?

2851
02:42:54,130 --> 02:42:56,050
对  因为我做的是科学探索
Yes, because this was work of exploration,

2852
02:42:56,050 --> 02:42:58,550
不是武器研制
it was not the preparation of a weapon.

2853
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:00,560
你是说这更像种学术涉猎
You mean it was more of an academic excursion?

2854
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:02,220
不  如果能造出氢弹
No, it is not an academic thing,

2855
02:43:02,230 --> 02:43:03,810
就不是学术了
whether you can build a hydrogen bomb.

2856
02:43:03,810 --> 02:43:05,100
而是生死攸关的大事
It's a matter of life and death.

2857
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:06,940
你在1942年
By 1942, you were actively pushing

2858
02:43:06,940 --> 02:43:08,480
曾积极推动氢弹研制  不是吗
the development of the hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

2859
02:43:08,480 --> 02:43:09,940
"推动"这个词不恰当
Pushing is not the right word.

2860
02:43:09,940 --> 02:43:11,820
是支持并参与研究
Supporting it and working on it, yes.

2861
02:43:11,820 --> 02:43:14,110
那这种道义上的不安是何时变得如此强烈
So when did these moral qualms become so strong

2862
02:43:14,110 --> 02:43:17,490
强到让你积极反对氢弹研制
that you actively opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb?

2863
02:43:17,490 --> 02:43:20,080
当有人说美国的政策是
When it was suggested that it be the policy of the United States

2864
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:21,790
不惜一切代价制造出这些武器
to make these things at all costs,

2865
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:24,330
而不考虑这些武器
without regard to the balance between these weapons

2866
02:43:24,330 --> 02:43:26,830
和我们的武器库中已有的核武器之间的平衡
and atomic weapons as part of our arsenal.

2867
02:43:28,340 --> 02:43:30,500
这与道义上的不安有什么关系
What do moral qualms have to do with that?

2868
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:33,760
-与道义上的不安有什么关系  -对
- What do moral qualms have to do with it? - Yes.

2869
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:36,010
奥本海默想独占原子弹
Oppenheimer wanted to own the atomic bomb.

2870
02:43:36,010 --> 02:43:38,010
他想成为撼动地球之人
He wanted to be The Man Who Moved the Earth.

2871
02:43:38,010 --> 02:43:42,520
他现在说要把"核妖魔"关回瓶中
He talks about putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle.

2872
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:44,770
告诉你吧  我非常清楚
Well, I'm here to tell you that I know,

2873
02:43:45,020 --> 02:43:47,940
如果能重头来过  J·罗伯特·奥本海默
J. Robert Oppenheimer, if he could do it all over,

2874
02:43:47,940 --> 02:43:49,560
还是会做出相同选择
he'd do it all the same.

2875
02:43:49,560 --> 02:43:53,230
知道吗  他从未说过对轰炸广岛感到后悔
You know he's never once said that he regrets Hiroshima?

2876
02:43:53,240 --> 02:43:55,570
他还是会这么做  为什么
He'd do it all over. Why?

2877
02:43:55,860 --> 02:44:00,490
因为这让他成为有史以来最重要的人
Because it made him the most important man who ever lived.

2878
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:03,790
我们不加限制地使用原子弹
We freely used the atomic bomb.

2879
02:44:03,790 --> 02:44:05,910
博士  事实上你协助选择了
In fact, Doctor, you assisted in selecting the target

2880
02:44:05,910 --> 02:44:08,290
在日本投放原子弹的目标  不是吗
to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, didn't you?

2881
02:44:08,750 --> 02:44:10,040
-对...  -那你知道  对吧
- Yes... - Well then, you knew, did you not,

2882
02:44:10,040 --> 02:44:12,550
向你选择的目标投放原子弹
that by dropping that atomic bomb on the target you selected,

2883
02:44:12,550 --> 02:44:14,670
会有成千上万的平民伤亡
that thousands of civilians would be killed or injured.

2884
02:44:14,670 --> 02:44:15,760
对吗
Is that correct?

2885
02:44:16,090 --> 02:44:17,840
对  我没想到会有那么多
Yes, not as many as turned out.

2886
02:44:17,840 --> 02:44:20,550
那有多少人伤亡
Oh. Then how many were killed or injured?

2887
02:44:20,850 --> 02:44:23,260
-七万人  -七万人  广岛和...
- 70,000. - 70,000, both Hiroshima and...

2888
02:44:23,270 --> 02:44:26,480
-总计十一万人  -轰炸当天的伤亡人数吗
- 110,000 to both. - On the day of each bombing?

2889
02:44:28,060 --> 02:44:28,890
对
Yes.

2890
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:30,350
轰炸数周及数年以后呢
And in the weeks and years that followed?

2891
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:33,520
估计有五至十万人
It has been put at somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000.

2892
02:44:33,530 --> 02:44:35,230
至少有二十二万人死亡
220,000 dead, at least.

2893
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:37,450
-是的  -对此你会良心有愧吗
- Yes. - Any moral scruples about that?

2894
02:44:39,410 --> 02:44:40,280
备受煎熬
Terrible ones.

2895
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:41,570
但你却在这里言之凿凿
But yet you testified in here

2896
02:44:41,580 --> 02:44:44,330
说轰炸广岛非常成功
that the bombing of Hiroshima was very successful.

2897
02:44:44,410 --> 02:44:47,330
-技术上很成功  -技术上非常成功
- Technically successful. - Oh! Technically it was very successful.

2898
02:44:47,330 --> 02:44:49,750
据说这加速了战争的结束
And it is also alleged to have helped to end the war.

2899
02:44:49,750 --> 02:44:50,460
你会支持
Would you have been supportive

2900
02:44:50,460 --> 02:44:53,090
向广岛投放氢弹吗
of the dropping of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

2901
02:44:53,090 --> 02:44:54,670
这根本没有意义
That would make no sense at all.

2902
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:57,300
-为什么  -目标太小
- Why? - The target is too small.

2903
02:44:57,300 --> 02:44:59,430
假设日本有足够大的
Well, supposing there had been a target in Japan

2904
02:44:59,430 --> 02:45:01,180
可以投放热核武器的目标
big enough for a thermonuclear weapon,

2905
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:02,680
你会反对投放吗
would you have been opposed to the dropping of it?

2906
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:04,640
我当时没遇到这样的问题
This was not a problem with which I was confronted.

2907
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,430
那我现在问你  先生
Well, I'm confronting you with it now, sir.

2908
02:45:06,430 --> 02:45:07,930
这都是他计划的一部分
It was all part of his plan.

2909
02:45:07,930 --> 02:45:11,900
他想要那种荣耀  自大  不真诚的负罪感
He wanted the glorious, insincere guilt of the self-important

2910
02:45:11,900 --> 02:45:14,360
像王冠一样戴在头上  并说
to wear like a fucking crown and say,

2911
02:45:14,360 --> 02:45:16,860
"不  我们不能走上这条路"
"No, we cannot go down this road,"

2912
02:45:16,860 --> 02:45:19,650
即使他知道我们不得不这样做
even as he knew we'd have to.

2913
02:45:19,650 --> 02:45:21,160
你会因为道德顾虑
Would you have been opposed to the dropping

2914
02:45:21,160 --> 02:45:23,870
反对向日本投放热核武器吗
of a thermonuclear weapon on Japan because of moral scruples?

2915
02:45:23,870 --> 02:45:25,240
是的  我想我会  先生
Yes, I believe I would, sir.

2916
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:27,490
你反对向广岛投放原子弹
Did you oppose the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima

2917
02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:28,790
是因为道德顾虑吗
because of moral scruples?

2918
02:45:28,790 --> 02:45:31,210
-我们阐述了我们的...  -不  你你你你
- We set forth our... - No, you, you, you, you!

2919
02:45:31,210 --> 02:45:32,210
-我问的是你...  -我阐...
- I'm asking you... - I set...

2920
02:45:32,210 --> 02:45:34,590
-你你你  -我阐述了我们
- You, you, you! - I set forth our arguments

2921
02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:36,880
反对投放的理由  但我并不支持不投
against dropping it, but I did not endorse them.

2922
02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:38,380
你是说日以继夜工作三年
You mean after working night and day

2923
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:40,130
造出原子弹后
for three years building the bomb,

2924
02:45:40,130 --> 02:45:42,340
你却反对使用它
you then argued against the use of it?

2925
02:45:42,430 --> 02:45:44,640
战争部长当时询问我
I was asked by the Secretary of War

2926
02:45:44,640 --> 02:45:46,010
科学家们的看法
what the views of scientists were.

2927
02:45:46,010 --> 02:45:48,600
我告诉了他们反对和赞成的意见
I gave them the views against and the views for.

2928
02:45:48,600 --> 02:45:50,560
你赞成向日本投放
You supported the dropping of the atom bomb

2929
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:51,640
-原子弹  对吗  -你什么意思...
- on Japan, didn't you? - What do you mean...

2930
02:45:51,650 --> 02:45:53,440
-你赞成...  -你说"赞成"是什么意思
- You supported it... - What do you mean, support?

2931
02:45:53,440 --> 02:45:54,940
你帮助选择了目标  不是吗
Well, you helped pick the target, didn't you?

2932
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:58,610
我是公事公办  我在洛斯阿拉莫斯没有决策权
I did my job. I was not in a policy-making position at Los Alamos.

2933
02:45:58,610 --> 02:46:00,570
命令我做什么我就做什么
I would have done anything I was asked to do.

2934
02:46:00,570 --> 02:46:02,990
那你本来也该造出氢弹的  不是吗
Well, then, you would have built the H-bomb too, wouldn't you?

2935
02:46:02,990 --> 02:46:05,450
-但我没法...  -我没问你这个  博士
- But I couldn't... - I didn't ask you that, Doctor!

2936
02:46:05,450 --> 02:46:07,830
苏联核试验后  你与人合署的
And the GAC report, which you co-authored

2937
02:46:07,830 --> 02:46:09,870
总顾问委员会报告上写道
after the Soviet atomic test said:

2938
02:46:09,870 --> 02:46:12,830
"永远不该造出氢弹"
"A super bomb should never be built!"

2939
02:46:12,830 --> 02:46:14,380
我们的意思是  我的意思是...
What we meant, what I meant...

2940
02:46:14,380 --> 02:46:15,710
-"我们"是谁  -听着  我的意思是...
- What you, who? - Look, what I meant...

2941
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:16,500
谁
Who?

2942
02:46:18,050 --> 02:46:21,090
苏联人难道不会尽全力增强自己的军事实力吗
Well, wouldn't the Russians do anything to increase their strength?

2943
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:23,550
如果我们造出来了  他们就必须造出来
If we did it, they would have to do it!

2944
02:46:23,550 --> 02:46:25,720
我们的努力只会让他们更努力
Our efforts would only fuel their efforts,

2945
02:46:25,720 --> 02:46:27,970
就像原子弹那样
just as it had with the atomic bomb!

2946
02:46:27,970 --> 02:46:30,640
没错  就像原子弹那样
Just as it had with the atomic bomb, exactly!

2947
02:46:31,770 --> 02:46:36,060
1945年毫无道德顾虑  1949年顾虑重重
No moral scruples in 1945, plenty in 1949.

2948
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:41,650
奥本海默博士...
Dr. Oppenheimer...

2949
02:46:43,660 --> 02:46:46,320
你对氢弹强烈的道德感
when did your strong moral convictions develop

2950
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:48,490
是什么时候形成的
with respect to the hydrogen bomb?

2951
02:46:56,130 --> 02:46:57,790
当我明白
When it became clear to me

2952
02:46:59,250 --> 02:47:02,510
我们会动用手中的任何武器时
that we would tend to use any weapon we had.

2953
02:47:05,470 --> 02:47:07,640
殉道者J·罗伯特·奥本海默
J. Robert Oppenheimer the martyr,

2954
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:10,520
我正好满足了他的心愿
I gave him exactly what he wanted.

2955
02:47:10,970 --> 02:47:12,680
因"三位一体"而被世人铭记
To be remembered for Trinity,

2956
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:14,690
不是因为广岛
not Hiroshima!

2957
02:47:15,310 --> 02:47:17,480
也不是因为长崎
Not Nagasaki!

2958
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:22,280
他应该感谢我
He should be thanking me.

2959
02:47:23,240 --> 02:47:24,450
他并不
Well, he's not.

2960
02:47:27,870 --> 02:47:29,410
我们的票数还够吗
Do we still have enough votes?

2961
02:47:29,410 --> 02:47:31,290
还是我职业生涯的巅峰时刻
Or is the crowning moment of my career

2962
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:34,710
即将成为我人生中最大的公开羞辱
about to become the most public humiliation of my life?

2963
02:47:35,250 --> 02:47:37,250
参议院全体议员即将投票
Full Senate's about to vote.

2964
02:47:37,960 --> 02:47:39,080
你会勉强通过
You'll scrape through.

2965
02:47:39,090 --> 02:47:40,840
很好  那召集媒体吧
Great, then gather the fucking press.

2966
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:42,710
J·罗伯特·奥本海默博士
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer,

2967
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:45,630
本委员会听取了你
this board, having heard testimony from you

2968
02:47:45,630 --> 02:47:49,050
及你的许多前同事和现同事的证词
and many of your current and former colleagues,

2969
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:53,270
我们得出一致结论  你是个忠诚的公民
has come to the unanimous conclusion that you are a loyal citizen.

2970
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:56,440
然而...
However...

2971
02:47:57,400 --> 02:48:00,610
鉴于你一直与共党分子牵扯不清
In the light of your continuing associations,

2972
02:48:00,610 --> 02:48:04,240
以及你对本国安全机构的漠视
and disregard for the security apparatus of this country,

2973
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:07,780
外加你在氢弹项目上
together with your somewhat disturbing conduct

2974
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:09,660
令人不安的行为
on the hydrogen bomb program,

2975
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:11,330
并且很遗憾  你对本委员会的
and the regrettable lack of candor

2976
02:48:11,330 --> 02:48:13,950
一些回应缺乏坦诚
in certain of your responses to this board,

2977
02:48:14,580 --> 02:48:16,540
经过投票  2比1
we have voted, two-to-one,

2978
02:48:17,420 --> 02:48:20,580
我们拒绝延长你的安全许可
to deny the renewal of your security clearance.

2979
02:48:20,590 --> 02:48:23,960
完整的书面意见  包括埃文斯先生的异议
A full written opinion, with a dissent from Mr. Evans,

2980
02:48:24,130 --> 02:48:27,090
几天后将呈交原子能委员会
will be issued to the AEC in the coming days.

2981
02:48:27,220 --> 02:48:28,090
会议结束
That is all.

2982
02:48:39,230 --> 02:48:42,190
罗伯特  罗伯特
Robert. Robert.

2983
02:48:45,490 --> 02:48:46,780
别...
Don't...

2984
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:50,950
别收床单
Don't take in the sheets.

2985
02:48:56,700 --> 02:48:58,830
两分钟  就两分钟
Two minutes. Two minutes!

2986
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,460
会让你们拍的
You'll get your shot!

2987
02:49:04,050 --> 02:49:05,760
正式宣布了吗
Is it official?

2988
02:49:07,510 --> 02:49:11,430
有几个意料之外的反对者
Well, there were a couple of unexpected holdouts.

2989
02:49:16,470 --> 02:49:18,770
我被否决了  对吗
I'm denied. Yeah?

2990
02:49:19,310 --> 02:49:21,100
-恐怕是的  先生  -好吧
- I'm afraid so, sir. - Alright.

2991
02:49:28,740 --> 02:49:29,990
反对者有谁
Who were the holdouts?

2992
02:49:29,990 --> 02:49:32,870
有三位
Um, there were three.

2993
02:49:32,870 --> 02:49:35,410
以马萨诸塞州的新晋参议员为首
Led by the junior senator from Massachusetts.

2994
02:49:35,410 --> 02:49:36,990
一个想出名的年轻人
Young guy trying to make a name for himself,

2995
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,290
不喜欢你对奥本海默所做的事
didn't like what you did to Oppenheimer.

2996
02:49:39,910 --> 02:49:40,960
他叫什么
What's his name?

2997
02:49:41,620 --> 02:49:43,460
肯尼迪
Uh, Kennedy.

2998
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:44,960
约翰·F·肯尼迪
John F. Kennedy.

2999
02:49:48,680 --> 02:49:49,590
吉蒂
Kitty?

3000
02:49:56,140 --> 02:49:59,890
你以为任由他们肆意凌虐你
Did you think that if you let them tar and feather you,

3001
02:49:59,890 --> 02:50:01,770
全世界就会原谅你吗
then the world would forgive you?

3002
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:06,770
不会的
It won't.

3003
02:50:09,280 --> 02:50:10,320
我们走着瞧
We'll see.

3004
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:26,790
你说我会没事的
You told me I'd be okay.

3005
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:29,380
对  但你没把所有事告诉我  对吗
Yeah, well, I didn't have all the facts, did I?

3006
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:30,630
事实上
Here's a fact.

3007
02:50:30,630 --> 02:50:32,800
艾森豪威尔总统去年亲手在我胸前
President Eisenhower pinned the Medal of Freedom

3008
02:50:32,800 --> 02:50:34,720
别上自由勋章
on my chest last year,

3009
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:37,100
因为我做的都是利国利民的事
because I've always done what's right for this country.

3010
02:50:37,100 --> 02:50:41,310
他们不希望我进入内阁  没...  没关系
They don't want me in the cabinet room? Well, that's... that's fine.

3011
02:50:41,890 --> 02:50:44,230
也许他们应该转而邀请奥本海默
Maybe they should just invite Oppenheimer instead.

3012
02:50:44,230 --> 02:50:45,400
也许他们会的
Maybe they will.

3013
02:50:46,230 --> 02:50:49,320
我告诉过你  他唆使那些科学家反对我
I told you. He turned the scientists against me,

3014
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:51,240
从爱因斯坦开始  一个接着一个
one by one, starting with Einstein.

3015
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:53,900
我跟你说过  爱因斯坦  爱因斯坦在池塘边
I told you about that. Einstein. Einstein by the pond.

3016
02:50:53,910 --> 02:50:56,620
是的  但先生  既然没人...
You did, but you know, sir, since nobody...

3017
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:59,200
真正知道他们那天到底聊了什么
really knows what they said to each other that day,

3018
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:02,750
有没有可能他们根本没说起你
is it possible they didn't talk about you at all?

3019
02:51:03,060 --> 02:51:05,420
有没有可能他们聊的是...
Is it possible they spoke about something, uh...

3020
02:51:06,380 --> 02:51:07,500
更重要的事
more important?

3021
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:11,340
施特劳斯先生  看这里  施特劳斯先生
Mr. Strauss. Over here! Mr. Strauss!

3022
02:51:22,610 --> 02:51:23,730
谢谢
Thank you.

3023
02:51:24,010 --> 02:51:25,140
阿尔伯特
Albert.

3024
02:51:28,610 --> 02:51:30,320
当下风云人物
The man of the moment.

3025
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:38,490
你曾在伯克利为我办过一场招待会
You once held a reception for me in Berkeley.

3026
02:51:38,490 --> 02:51:40,990
-你给我颁了奖  -是的
- You gave me an award, hmm? - Yes.

3027
02:51:42,040 --> 02:51:44,540
你们都以为我已无法理解
You all thought that I had lost the ability

3028
02:51:44,540 --> 02:51:46,920
我所开创的领域
to understand what I'd started.

3029
02:51:47,500 --> 02:51:48,290
所以...
So...

3030
02:51:48,840 --> 02:51:53,090
那个奖不是颁给我的  是给你们的  对吗
The award really wasn't for me, it was for all of you, hmm?

3031
02:51:55,130 --> 02:51:56,510
现在轮到你
Now it's your turn

3032
02:51:57,340 --> 02:52:01,850
来解决自己的成就带来的问题
to deal with the consequences of your achievement.

3033
02:52:02,890 --> 02:52:06,520
终有一天  等他们对你惩罚够了
And one day, when they've punished you enough,

3034
02:52:08,520 --> 02:52:12,360
就会给你奉上三文鱼和土豆沙拉
they'll serve you salmon and potato salad.

3035
02:52:16,450 --> 02:52:17,990
演讲称颂你
Make speeches.

3036
02:52:19,180 --> 02:52:20,620
给你颁奖
Give you a medal.

3037
02:52:22,740 --> 02:52:24,120
你好  弗兰克
Hello, Frank.

3038
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:26,210
你幸福  我就幸福
You're happy, I'm happy.

3039
02:52:32,800 --> 02:52:35,630
拍着你的背告诉你  一切都过去了
Pat you on the back, tell you all is forgiven.

3040
02:52:37,300 --> 02:52:38,630
记住...
Just remember...

3041
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:42,430
那些都不是为了你
it won't be for you.

3042
02:52:47,480 --> 02:52:48,980
而是为了他们自己
It'll be for them.

3043
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:03,370
阿尔伯特...
Albert...

3044
02:53:05,660 --> 02:53:08,620
当我带着那些计算结果去找你时
when I came to you with those calculations,

3045
02:53:08,870 --> 02:53:10,960
我们都以为我们可能会触发
we thought we might start a chain reaction

3046
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:14,420
摧毁整个世界的链式反应
that would destroy the entire world.

3047
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:19,180
我记得  怎么了
I remember it well. What of it?

3048
02:53:22,760 --> 02:53:24,220
我想我们触发了
I believe we did.
