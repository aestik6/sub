还有什么条件
What's it gonna take?

35
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:17,547
就算要我今天往你家运一台古董捷豹
You want me to send a vintage Jaguar over to your house today?

36
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,006
我也会照做
I'll do it.

37
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:23,052
我明白 但是...
Um, s-sure. Look, um...

38
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:25,137
就底价而言
I just think bottom line,

39
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,599
我要为自家股东们创造更大的价值
I can deliver a lot more value for our shareholders.

40
00:05:29,058 --> 00:05:31,435
希望这不会对你造成困扰

44
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,157
别这样 到此为止吗
Come on. That's it?

45
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:48,327
不能这样结束 搞毛线呢
That's not it. What the fuck happened?

46
00:05:50,663 --> 00:05:52,290
等一下
Yo, hang on.

47
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,085
慢着 慢着
Hold up, hold up.

48

54
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,059
总之 去你妈的 小屁孩
Well, fuck you, daddy's boy.

55
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:16,314
别这样 这事儿不能吹
Hey, come on. Don't blow this up.

This is the secret sauce.

72
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,110
我们要给个更诱人的出价吗
Do we need to sweeten the offer?

73
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,946
你想把出价再提高一个点吗
You wanna bump the offer another point?

74

还有人要给老爸打电话的吗
Does anybody wanna call their dad?

81
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,965
行 没人想他妈跟自己老爸讲话
OK, nobody wants to talk to their fucking dad.

82
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:27,134
那么 既然开始了 就把那破公司买下来
So, we've started, so let's buy this fucking company.

88
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,025
还算顺利
Yeah, it's OK.

89
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:45,236
但离成功还差一点
We're not quite closed.

90
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:47,363
我打算提到1.2亿
I'm going to 120.

97
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,509

00:10:51,297 --> 00:10:54,466
其实不是我 而是那小孩
Well, not me, actually, but this kid.

147
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:55,426
格雷格
Greg.

148
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:58,470
有个小孩在我车里抽了一根大麻
So, this kid smoked a joint in my car.

149
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,555
小孩
A kid.

150
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:01,515
就今早我接上的那个
Like this hitchhiker kid that I

151
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:03,350
搭便车的小孩 早些时候那会儿
picked up this morning, like earlier this morning.

152
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,603
因为那时在下雨 我不想...
'Cause it was raining and I didn't want...

153
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:08,564
不想他被坏人性骚扰之类的
I didn't want him to get sexually assaulted?

154
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:09,190
格雷格
Greg.

155
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,566
我还没说啥呢...
Before I could even say anything...

156
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:11,317
你搞毛呢
What the fuck?

157
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,986
他上车就点了一根...
Aggressively takes out...

158
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:16,780
就是你知不知道 那种 大麻烟
Have you ever seen, like, so, a doobie?

159
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,575
车里都是焦臭的大麻味儿
And the car smelled like skunk weed.

160
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:21,660
我身上也是那味
And then I guess I smelled like it.

161
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,329
他们就说
And then they were just like,

162
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:25,539
"收拾东西滚蛋"
"Get all your stuff and go. "

163
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:26,749
格雷格
Greg.

164
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:28,709
你有没有想过告诉他们
Did you even think for one second

165
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,002
你是谁
to tell them who you are?

166
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:30,836
没有 我觉得...
No, I thought...

167
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,254
我不想当个混蛋
I didn't wanna be an asshole

168
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:33,756
也不想掺和进去
or get into it all.

169
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:34,798
-好吧  -我也不知道
- OK. - I don't know.

170
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:36,133
你接下来这样做
Here's what you're gonna do.

171
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,427
买张去纽约的机票
You're gonna get a plane ticket to New York.

172
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,511
是你伯伯...
It's your Uncle...

173
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,347
大伯父洛根要过生日
Your Great-Uncle Logan's birthday,

174
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,806
要办一个大型生日宴会
and they're having a big party.

175
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,808
我会打给玛西娅说你要去
I'll call Marcia and tell her you're coming.

176
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,018
他要过生日吗
It's his birthday?

177
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,519
你去参加派对
You're gonna go to the party.

178
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,563
再送一份体面的礼物
You're gonna get him a nice gift.

179
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:51,315
还要看着英俊潇洒
And you're gonna look nice.

180
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:54,151
穿上成年人的衬衫和西装
In a grown-up shirt and a grown-up blazer.

181
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,527
西装
A blazer?

182
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:57,571
我告诉你怎么做
I'll let you know.

183
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:01,367
不给出一个大数目他们是不会让步的
They're not gonna budge unless it gets to be a stupid number.

184
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:02,743
多大算大
What's a stupid number?

185
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:04,453
多大 数兆亿吗 谁知道
What's stupid? A "badillion"? I don't know.

186
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,914
因为1.2亿够大了 不是吗
Because 120 is stupid. Am I wrong?

187
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:08,082
1.2亿是个大数目
120 is a stupid number.

188
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:09,333
这已经不是钱的事情了
But it's not really a money thing right now.

189
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,834
罗伊先生 有人找您
Mr. Roy, someone's here to see you.

190
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:13,504
-好 谁找我  -打扰 是肯德尔·罗伊吗
- OK. Who's this? - Hi, Kendall Roy?

191
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:14,338

Yeah, hi.

192
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:18,801
罗曼派我来烧点鼠尾草
I was sent by Roman to burn some sage.

193
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:20,135
你说什么
Excuse me?

194
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:21,387
求个好彩头
It's auspicious.

195
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,639
我是个商业炼金师
I'm a business alchemist.

196
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,474
这是你弟送你的礼物
It's a gift, from your brother.

197
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:26,809
会触发烟雾报警器吗
Will it set off the smoke alarms?

198
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,102
通常不会
Not usually.

199
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:29,353
啥叫通常
Not usually?

200
00:12:29,853 --> 00:12:31,855
嘿 混蛋们
Hey, hey, motherfuckers!

201
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:35,025
-罗曼  -我的人吗
- Roman. - My guy?

202
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,402
开始烧了吗
Are you saging?

203
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,737
我们担心这会触发警报
Well, we're concerned about the alarms.

204
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,864
说得是啊 巫术
Ooh, right, yeah, the bad juju.

205
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:42,908
我可以用精油代替
Now, I can use essential oils.

206
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:44,785
你可以滚蛋了 谢谢
Oh, I think just fuck off, thanks.

207
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:46,245
你最近咋样
How ya doing?

208
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:49,832
不错 我们正在商议对策
Good. Good. Just finessing.

209
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:52,543
商议对策 很好
Mm. Finessing. Nice.

210
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:53,585
再见
Bye.

211
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,504
他很不错
He's good.

212
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:57,006
你没事吧
You OK, man?

213
00:12:57,798 --> 00:13:00,592
我吗 好啊 好得不行了
OK? Yes, I'm OK. Obviously.

214
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,011
这还用问吗
Why would you even ask that?

215
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,971
不知道 问问而已
I don't know. Just, you know.

216
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:08,267
回来吗 早就翻篇了 我不适合这里
Here? Man, I'm so over it. I was a bad fit.

217
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:10,686
我从来不是拍企业主马屁的料
I was never a corporate cock-suck anyway.

218
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:13,188
更何况 我在这栋楼里从来没有爬到这么高
Besides, I never made it this high in the fucking building!

219
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:15,274
他们把我丢在洛杉矶混日子
They stuck me in LA with Old Father Time right here.

220
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:16,775
咱们以前是泳池兄弟 对吗 弗兰克
We were the pool boys, right, Frank?

221
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,068
记得香蕉小屋吗
Fuckin' banana cabana?

222
00:13:18,068 --> 00:13:19,445
都是美好时光
Good times.

223
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,657
目前竞价是多少
So, what's the bid?

224
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:25,284
-你问竞价吗  -对
- What's the bid? - Mm-hmm.

225
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,037
这个...
Well...

226
00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:31,165
怎么 这还算商业机密了
What? That's commercially sensitive?

227
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,708
我可还在董事会呢 兄弟
I'm still on the board, man.

228
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,835
要到1.25亿了
Going 125.

229
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:36,545
1.25亿吗
One-twenty-five?

230
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:38,005
-怎么了  -我去
- What? - Fuck!

231
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:39,506
怎么 高了还是低了
What? High or low?

232
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:41,675
-你笑什么  -没什么
- You're laughing. What? - No.

233
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,010
-为了买沃尔特 对吗  -是啊
- For Vaulter, right? - Yeah.

234
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,220
那个没啥内涵的商标吗
Bit of content and a brand name?

235
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,514
没啥内涵的商标就是精髓
Bit of content and a brand name kinda's the whole game.

236
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:48,474
-不是吗  -好吧
- Isn't it? - Mm-hmm.

237
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,017
你到底在笑什么？
What are you laughing at?

238
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,186
我不知道我在说什么
I don't know what I'm talking about.

239
00:13:52,186 --> 00:13:53,771
反正你马上要当这艘船的船长了
You're gonna be captain of the ship soon enough.

240
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:54,813
-我不...  -嘘
- So I don't... - Shh.

241
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:57,274
糟糕
Oh, shit.

242
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,027
抱歉 去你妈的
Sorry. Fuck you, man.

243
00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:02,571
街上的所有实习生都知道你要上位了
Every intern on the street knows that you're stepping up.

244
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:04,490
恭喜你 真心的
Seriously, congrats.

245
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:05,949
能离开这里我实在太高兴了
I'm just so pleased to be out of here.

246
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:08,077
这里对我简直就像个牢笼
This place was essentially a cage to me.

247
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:11,080
我该走了 管他妈的
I should take off. Fuck it.

248
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:12,081
恭喜你 兄弟
Hey, congrats, man.

249
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:13,540
谢谢你过来
Thanks for coming by.

250
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,588
瞧这胡诌八扯的地方
Look at all this fuckin' bullshit!

251
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:24,510
我很严肃的哦
Mm, yes, mm, very serious, mm.

252
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:27,471
爱你哦 老哥

Good.

254
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,753
好
Right.

255
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:02,464
把它们都摆正 明白吗
Just keep everything straight, OK?

256
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,134
很好
Good.

257
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:25,237
对了 还要加一套新餐具
By the way, we need another setting.

258
00:15:25,237 --> 00:15:27,364
还有一位家庭成员要来
Another family member is coming.

259
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:36,623
-玛西  -怎么了
- Marcy. - What?

260
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:39,418
我要出去 定好了的

261
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:42,838
好的 一点前回来...
Great. Till 1:00...

262
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:44,798
好吧 但惊喜就在这里 好吗
Fine. But in here, yeah?

263
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:47,259
我他妈可不想被吓出心脏病
I don't want a fuckin' heart attack from the surprise.

264
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:50,179
我出电梯时 不想看到任何人朝我欢呼
And I don't want anyone in my face when I come out of the elevator.

265
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:51,972
保持好距离
Right. Distance.

266
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:54,349
把他们安排在这 还有...
Have them here. And, uh...

267

-怎么了  -小点声
- What? - Not too loud.

268
00:15:57,144 --> 00:16:01,064
你希望我把惊喜的精准细节发给你吗
Do you want me to email you the exact details of the surprise?

269
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,233
想吗
Yeah?

270
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:06,236
-待会儿见  -好

274
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:12,618

Of course.

275
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:16,163
-再仔细检查一遍  -好的
- Just double-check. - OK.

276
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:18,624
你打算多久去审演讲稿
When were you gonna look at that speech?

277
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,334
我周日晚上回来 到时候和他一起审 行吗
I'll be back by Sunday night so I'll look at his speech with him then, OK?

278
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:23,420
但他那边要在前周末拿到民调数据
OK, but his office wants the poll numbers by the preekend.

279
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:25,422
"前周末" 这他妈是啥玩意儿
The "preekend"? What the fuck's a "preekend"?

280
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:26,632
前周末就是周五
Preekend is Friday.

281
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:28,926
那他不能直接说是周五吗
If he wants them by Friday, can he not say Friday?

282
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:31,094
前周末是周四午后到周五中午
Thursday lunch through Friday afternoon is the preekend.

283
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,764

小西
Shiv.

285
00:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,850
真他妈是场灾难
This is a fuckin' disaster.

286
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,936
我得好好挑礼物
I got to strategize my gift.

287
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:40,479
他会喜欢什么礼物呢
What can I get him he'll love?

288
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,232
不清楚 我爸没什么喜好的
I don't know. My dad doesn't really like things.

289
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,608
他没什么喜好吗
He doesn't like things?

290
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:45,651
确实是这样
No, not really.

291
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,528
这份礼物要表达出
It needs to say that "I respect you,

292
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:48,946
"我尊重你 但我并不怕你
but I'm not awed by you.

293
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,198
我还... 欣赏你
And that I... I like you,

294
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,867
但我要你在我爱你之前 欣赏我"
but I need you to like me before I can love you."

295
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:55,869
所以选啥礼物好
So what says that?

296
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:57,454
听着 你买任何东西给他
Just, look, everything that you get him

297
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:59,289
都相当于没买
will mean an equal amount of nothing,

298
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,833
只要看上去价值一万到一万五就可以了
so make sure it looks like 10 to 15 grand's worth and you're good.

299
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,001
你能进来帮帮我吗
Will you come in here and help me?

300
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:03,752
好
Yes.

301
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:04,461
求你帮帮我
Please help me.

302
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,797
当然了 给他买块表吧
Yes. Get him a watch.

303
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:08,966
要是我们连股票也送
If we go stupid on the stock,

304
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:12,427
这份诱人的福利礼包看着如何
what does a really sexy package look like? Hmm?

305
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:13,720
他也许没有流动资金了 对吗
He's probably illiquid, right?

306
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,265
那我们要再投一千万吗
So, what, we throw in another ten million?

307
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,350
没准还要再来一次跪舔
Might need to throw in a blow job, too.

308
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,851
我来跪舔
I'll throw in a blow job.

309
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,229
我来跪舔
I'll throw in a blow job.

310
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:24,314
还要让他高潮
I'll throw in a reach-around.

311
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,442
见鬼 我还要捏他的蛋
Hell, I'll even cup his balls.

312
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:30,404
爸
Dad.

313
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:32,906
你这会儿该到圣巴特岛[加勒比度假岛]了啊
I thought you'd be in St. Barts by now.

314
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,452
-一切顺利吗  -还不错
- How's it goin'? - Good.

315
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:39,830
是的 挺好的
Uh, yeah. Fine. Good.

316
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:42,833
你怎么...
Uh, why are you...

317
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:45,294
我们没事吧
Are we OK?

318
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,254
当然 就是些文件而已
Yeah, it's just some paperwork.

319
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:49,214
怎么 发布会前还有吗
What, ahead of the announcement?

320
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:53,135
我要把玛西纳为信托人... 破事一桩
Putting Marcy on the trust. It's... bullshit.

321
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,430
然后就想顺路过来瞧瞧
I, uh, I just felt like checkin' in.

322
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,599
是吗 好啊
Oh. Yeah, fine.

323
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:01,560
-只是改信托人吗  -对
- So this is just the trust? - Yeah.

324
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,437
不会阻碍我升职吧
Doesn't affect me stepping up?

325
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:05,939
不 不 不会的 我好像跟你谈过了
No, no, no, no, no. I think I told you about it.

326
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:08,900
这是...
Is that...

327
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:11,903
抱歉 父亲 我这边正忙...
Sorry, Dad, I'm kind of in the middle of...

328
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:15,073
你需要... 需要我走法律形式吗
Do you need... Do I need to lawyer all this?

329
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,700
一些家务而已
It's housekeeping.

330
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,252
好吧 我对玛西没意见
Fine. Yeah. Yeah. Marcy's fine by me.

331
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:32,549
我是说 那几个家伙可能不这么想 但...
I mean, the others might not feel the same, but...

332
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,051
我会处理的
I'll deal with that.

333
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:41,141
那我们...
So, I'll see you in...

334
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,769
对了 爸 午饭这事
Yeah, look, Dad, on lunch.

335
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:47,147
我很想陪你的 但是生意...
I really want to be with you, but the deal...

336
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:48,357
-儿子  -你知道的
- Son. - You know.

337
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:51,818
你自己决定吧
It's your call.

338
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:54,071
分清主次
Just priorities.

339
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:56,114
这种事以后只会更多
There'll be plenty more.

340
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:59,034
麦穗的故事 记得吗
Uh-oh. Wheat.

341
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:02,329
再见 弗兰克
Bye, Frank.

342
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:04,122
再见 老朋友
All right, amigo.

343
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,712
我有五个农场 而这些农场下面
I have five farms, and underneath all my farms

344
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:14,007
有个非常大的蓄水池 像地下湖那种
runs a big, giant aquifer that's like an underground lake.

345
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,510
-真酷啊  -我有抽水权
- That's so cool! - I have pumping rights.

346
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:18,095
就是说我能拥有那些水
That means I get to take the water.

347
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,346
-太酷了  -还相当重要呢
- That's so cool! - And it's very important

348
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:20,931
因为有一天 水会比黄金还珍贵
because someday water's gonna be more precious than gold

349
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:23,392
人们会互相残杀 只为得到水
and people are gonna kill each other to try to get that water.

350
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:26,687
悠着点 康纳 别这样
Oh, hey, hey, Con, don't, don't.

351
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,188

- Don't listen to him. - Right, right, sorry.

352
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:29,564
但我会拿到水的
But I'm gonna have the water.

353
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:30,649
然后就分享给你
And I'll share with you.

00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:56,863
管理培训计划
the management training program?

558
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:59,574
我需要回去继续参加培训
I need to get back in.

559
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:01,993
-你退出了吗  -是的
- You're out? - Yes.

560
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:04,913
出了点小问题 我跟我母亲说了
There was an issue, and I talked to my mom

561
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:07,665
她与我祖父提了一下 然后让我来找您
who talked to my grandfather and said that I can come to you

562
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:09,542
就能... 解决这个问题
and... and iron it out.

563
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,503
我愿意为兄弟两肋插刀
I'll do anything for my brother.

564
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:16,549
那... 那太好了
Oh, that's... that's nice.

565
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:18,760
我会拼尽全力...
And I'm gonna work 100%...

566
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,803
他只用求我就好
All he needs to do is just ask.

567
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:22,472
我的祖父吗
My grandfather?

568
00:28:24,307 --> 00:28:26,643
我是说 您二位交集甚少
I mean, you two don't talk so much.

569
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:27,477
对吧
Right?

570
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,729
两肋插刀
Anything.

571
00:28:30,188 --> 00:28:31,648
只要他来求我
Just get him to ask me.

572
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:39,906
操
Fuck!

573
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:45,828
-爸  -什么事
- Dad. - Yes.

574
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:47,038
你要说什么事
Yeah, what's the deal?

575
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,874
所以...
So...

576
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:54,003
假如我不幸去世 家族信托
On the family trust, which will decide the situation

577
00:28:54,003 --> 00:28:58,633
将掌控家族大局
in the event of my unlikely demise,

578
00:28:58,633 --> 00:29:01,886
我要让玛西取代我 和你们四个一道
I'm going to add Marcy to myself and you four.

579
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:03,554
是吗
Whoa. OK.

580
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,601
在我死后 我的位置要留给她
And my seat also to go to her on my death.

581
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:12,689
什么 等下 这就给了她双份投票权了
What? Wait, that gives her double voting weight.

582
00:29:12,689 --> 00:29:15,233
没错 我这里有几份文件...
Uh-huh. So I've got some paperwork...

583
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,567
等等 啥
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

584
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:19,153
在你那啥之后玛西娅有两票...
So Marcia will have two votes when you...

585
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:21,906
-"假如"他...  -小罗 才不是假如
- "If" he...  - Well, no, Rome, it's not an if.

586
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:23,324
抱歉啊 要是我不想让他...
Well, excuse me if I don't want him to...

587
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:25,618
小罗 这不是他的真正意图
Well, it's not really what we want in this case, Rome.

588
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:28,788
肯德尔已经签字了 但如果我能让你们全员...
Kendall's already signed, but if I can get you all to...

589
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:30,498
两票 我觉得我当时应该是没注意到...
Two votes? I don't think I was aware of that when I...

590
00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:32,709
混球 那你倒是读附属细则啊
Read the small print, asshole.

591
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:38,172
这看起来...
I mean, this looks...

592
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,303
我要跟我的律师谈谈 弄清各项内涵
I'm gonna have to talk to my lawyers, just for all the implications.

593
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:44,178
请便
Of course.

594
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:45,013
看清全局
Just to get the full picture.

595
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:46,264
当然 三思而后行
Sure, take a beat.

596
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:52,228
但听着 我喜欢那面包... 还是粘团...
But look, I love the bread... goo...

597
00:29:52,603 --> 00:29:55,940
但这才正是我最想要的礼物
But this is the present I really want.

598
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,609
四点前决定 行吗
By 4:00, good?

599
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:04,032
还有 我已经和肯德尔提过了
Oh, also, I already mentioned to Kendall,

600
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:08,328
除唠唠叨叨之外 其他的事都考虑到了
despite the chatter and all things considered,

601
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:10,788
我会再坚持几年
I'm going to give it a couple of years.

602
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:12,915
做什么
As in?

603
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:14,208
我会继续主持大局
I'll stay in situ.

604
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:17,795
仍然担任主席 总裁 公司的一把手
As chairman, CEO, head of the firm.

605
00:30:20,256 --> 00:30:23,092
爸 你... 说啥
Dad, wh... you... you what?

606
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,136
我才说完 我的儿
I just said, son,

607
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:27,138
还是说你一如既往地没听我说话
or were you not listening, as usual?

608
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:30,266
但我才是... 你不是... 什么
But I'm... You're not... What?

609
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,894
没啥大不了的 我要继续主持大局
It's no big deal. I'm staying on.

610
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:35,104
-细节好商量  -你没跟我说过
- We can discuss the details. - You didn't tell me.

611
00:30:35,104 --> 00:30:36,773
咱们能对外公布你仍留在决策圈
We can announce you're in pole position,

612
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:38,941
未定事项啊 升职什么的
pending events, a move up or whatever.

613
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:41,194
-"未定事项"  -行 不说了 吃饭吧
- "Pending events"? - OK, come on, let's eat.

614
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:43,988
爸 等一下
Dad, wait.

615
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:47,158
我操
Oh, fuck!

616
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:51,287
我不知道你他妈有什么好笑的
I don't know what you're fucking laughing about!

617
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:54,248
我根本没笑 搞毛呢
I'm not even laughing. What?!

618
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,793
操 操他妈的
Fuck. What the fuck.

619
00:30:57,335 --> 00:31:00,213
他不能就... 对吧
I mean, he can't just... Right?

620
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:02,715
公司的声誉都得被他玩坏
He's gonna blow the firm's credibility.

621
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:05,009
你们觉得他还撑得下去吗
Did he look OK to you?

622
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:08,971
得了 肯 这是爸典型的作风
Oh, come on! Ken, this is typical. It's Dad.

623
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:10,890
我不干了 总成吧
I'm out, OK?

624
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,141
不玩了
I'm not playing.

625
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:14,310
不管你仨如何决定 悉听尊便
Whatever you three decide, goes.

626
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,603
-拜拜了您哪  -康纳
- Goodbye. - Connor.

627
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:17,647
我拒绝在信托上玩玩闹闹
On the trust, I refuse to play.

628
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:21,567
我不想趟这浑水 我是清水 我流走还不行么
I don't want to engage. I'm water, I flow.

629
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:28,157
这根本站不住脚的 对吧
This doesn't stand, right?

630
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:29,700
我...
I...

631
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,162
还他娘的耸肩 耸你妹的肩啊
Oh, fucking shrug? You're fucking shrugging me?

632
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:38,334
你发短信呢是吧 哥们 你干什...
Are you texting? Dude, what are you...

633
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:39,502
说你呢
Hey, hey!

634
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:41,379
-你当长舌妇呢  -你他娘的那么认真干什么
- Are you telling? - Are you fucking serious?

635
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:43,589
-啥 你14岁小毛孩吗  -这件事绝不能外传
- What, are you 14? Private. - Hey, this stays in here.

636
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:45,800
-懂吗 这件事禁止外传  -我们都需要心理咨询 伙计
- OK? This is a lockdown. - We all need advice, man.

637
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,802
咨询 啥玩意儿 你要把两票
Advice? What? You're gonna give a double vote

638
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:49,512
交给一个权利控制狂吗
to a power-hungry maniac

639
00:31:49,512 --> 00:31:50,972
这人他妈指不定能弄出什么幺蛾子
who will do fuck-knows-what with it

640
00:31:50,972 --> 00:31:53,307
就因为她用她的大逼紧紧夹住了爸的屌
because she's got our dad's dick in some Super Max pussy grip

641
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:54,600
在他胡言乱语前给他灌了什么浆
and she's juicing him before he croaks?

642
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,894
大家伙 饭好了
Guys? Lunch is coming up.

643
00:31:59,522 --> 00:32:02,233
抱歉 我不想这么严格的
Sorry, I don't mean to be strict.

644
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:16,372
让我们单独待会儿 好吗 谢谢
Can you give us a minute, please? Thank you.

645
00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:23,796
所以说... 你阴了我一道
Hey. So... you fucked me.

646
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:26,799
我改主意了 肯德尔
I changed my mind, Kendall.

647
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,552
多久 多久改的
When? When, exactly.

648
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:31,471
因为我觉得你就是阴了我
'Cause it feels like you fucked me.

649
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:34,140
主要还是在我
It's me. It's mainly me.

650
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:38,686
但你... 三年前
But you... Three years ago,

651
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:40,646
你还在精神病院
you were still in the nuthouse.

652
00:32:41,272 --> 00:32:43,858
疗养 爸 那叫疗养
Rehab, Dad. It's called rehab.

653
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,193
而且我已经痊愈了
And I'm in recovery.

654
00:32:45,193 --> 00:32:46,402
都不是事
It's all good.

655
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:50,490
但我担心你会变软骨头
I'm just concerned you might be soft, as yet.

656
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,366
软骨头 你开玩笑吧
S-Soft? Are you kidding?

657
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,536
我他妈在上海待了一年
I did a fucking year in Shanghai.

658
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:58,164
我听说你任由网站公司那男的灭你士气
I hear you let the guy from the website trash-talk you

659
00:32:58,164 --> 00:32:59,582
你还毫无还击之力
and you just let him come.

660
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:00,708
那不是网站
It's not a website.

661
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:03,461
我也只是想专业点
And I was being professional.

662
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:06,881
我听说谈判很失败 逆向冲突
I hear it played weak. Conflict averse.

663
00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:09,425
我又不是卷进了什么"比谁屌大"的竞争
I wasn't about to get into a fucking big dick competition.

664
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:10,176
好吗
OK?

665
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:13,137
听说你向他低头了
I hear you bent for him.

666
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:14,514
什... 我什么
Wha... I what?

667
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:17,475
听说你低头求他 却反被搞了
I hear you bent for him and he fucked you.

668
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:21,687
其实并没有
Well, no, actually.

669
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:23,397
我知道你读了很多
I know that you've read a lot of books

670
00:33:23,397 --> 00:33:26,359
关于商务管理的这样那样的书
about business management and this and that,

671
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,152
但你猜怎么着
but you know what?

672
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:29,403
怎么着
What?

673
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:34,367
有时候这就是一场比谁屌大的竞争
Sometimes it is a big dick competition.

674
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:36,536
行 所以就这样了吗
OK. OK. So that's it?

675
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:40,414
所以我本该冲他们大喊 但我没有
So I should have shouted at some guy, but I didn't.

676
00:33:40,414 --> 00:33:43,584
于是你就撕毁了18个月的合作战略吗
So you've ripped up 18 months of corporate strategy?

677
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:45,253
你也别想染指信托改动
And you never lawyered the trust change.

678
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:47,588
我相信我父亲 这也能成了污点
I trusted my father. That's a black mark?

679
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:49,257
日积月累吧
It's an accumulation.

680
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:53,094
你离开了房间 谈生意的那间
You left the room. The deal.

681
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:55,054
来给我爸过他妈的生日
To come to my Dad's fucking birthday party

682
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,806
因为天知道你还能过几个生日
'cause we don't know how many more there'll be!

683
00:33:58,558 --> 00:33:59,392
对不起
Sorry.

684
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:00,768
告诉我吧
So come on.

685
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:03,813
你要多久能准备好
When will you be ready?

686
00:34:03,938 --> 00:34:05,064
下任
To step down?

687
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:06,107
我不知道
I don't know.

688
00:34:09,443 --> 00:34:10,361
五年吧
Five?

689
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,446
五年
Five years?

690
00:34:12,655 --> 00:34:13,197
十年吧
Ten?

691
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:15,366
十年 爸 开玩笑吧
Ten! Dad? Seriously!

692
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,578
这他妈是老子的公司
It's my fuckin' company.

693
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,871
没错 这他娘的是你的公司 但你猜怎么着
Yeah, it is your fucking company, and you know what?

694
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:24,584
你快要把它带到阴沟里了
You're running it into the fucking ground.

695
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,919
你一辈子都耗在了砸钱上...
You spend all your time on costs...

696
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:29,297
你的远见呢 你已经落后了
Where's the vision? You're off the beat.

697
00:34:29,297 --> 00:34:32,258
增益呢 数据全面下降 无一幸免
Where's the growth? All our graphs go down. All of them.

698
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:35,344
所以你要把十亿砸进一个破袖珍网站吗
Is that why you're paying a billion dollars for a gay little website?

699
00:34:35,344 --> 00:34:37,680
都他娘的说了不是网站
It is not a fucking website!

700

这是一个在线品牌及数字视频的组合产品
It's a portfolio of online brands and digital video content

701
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:44,186
如果你让我放手一搏 这也是能挽救
and it's part of an upstream investment strategy

702
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:46,480
我们公司的上游投资策略
to save us, if you'll just let me.

Do you want to hit me, is that it?

704
00:34:58,075 --> 00:34:58,826
对吧
Huh?

705
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:00,620

706
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:02,330
来呀
Go on.

707
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:04,540
你使出吃奶的劲儿来
Give it your best shot.

708
00:35:07,126 --> 00:35:09,211
爸 别这样 你在干嘛
Dad, come on. What are you doing?

709
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,798
你他娘的要哭不成
Are you gonna fuckin' cry?

710
00:35:15,384 --> 00:35:19,263
肯德尔 你他妈在哭鼻子吗
Kendall, are you fuckin' crying?

711
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:22,433
你知道局势已经漂浮不定了吗
You know, this has been floated already?

712
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:26,103
外面什么样的说法都有 总有人来找我证实
There's fucking paps outside. I'm getting asked for quotes.

713
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,313
操他们的
Fuck them.

714
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:29,315
是 当然 "操他们的"

牛 牛逼的媒体策略 爸
Great, great media strategy, Dad.

716
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:34,028
牛逼的商务策略
Great business strategy.

717
00:35:34,028 --> 00:35:37,073
-时移事易...  -对对对
- The world is changing... - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

718
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:38,991
万事万物都在变化
Yeah, everything changes.

719
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:41,744
我买工作室那会 它就快破产了
The studio was gonna tank when I bought it,

720
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:43,621
人人都想待在家里看录像
everyone was gonna stay home with video tapes.

721
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:47,583
但你猜怎么样 并不是 大家都想出门找乐子
But guess what? No! They wanna go out.

722
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,252
没人看什么电视网
No one was gonna watch Network,

723
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:52,922
除非你来点刺激的 他们就乐意看了
except you give it zing and they do.

724
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:54,632
创造你自己的现实吧
You make your own reality.

725
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,176
而一旦你成功了 显然
And once you've done it, apparently,

726
00:35:57,426 --> 00:36:01,263
每个人的观点都他娘的这么显而易见
everybody's of the opinion it was all so fucking obvious.

730
00:36:19,532 --> 00:36:21,367
我有点弄混了 不好意思
This is confusing. Sorry.

731
00:37:48,412 --> 00:37:51,457
她喝多了 坐到了戈尔·维达尔的腿上
She was drunk and sitting in Gore Vidal's lap.

732
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,209

746
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:30,496
打扰下 我说两句...
If you'll excuse me...

747
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:33,457
洛根·罗伊
Logan Roy.

748
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:38,587
八十年前的今天 他生于苏格兰的丹地
Born in Dundee, Scotland, 80 years ago today,

749
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:43,551
叔婶在魁北克把他抚养长大 叔叔有家印刷厂和几个广告牌
raised in Quebec by an uncle with a print shop and a few advertising billboards

750
00:38:44,009 --> 00:38:45,803
婶婶养着一群牛
and an aunt with a herd of cattle.

751
00:38:46,262 --> 00:38:51,016
洛根在过去的六十年中给自己拼出了一条路
Logan himself has made a decent way for himself these past 60 years.

752
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:55,855
建立起世界第五大传媒帝国
Fifth largest media conglomerate in the world.

753
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,651
他是首相的哥们儿 和总统们无话不谈
A pal to prime ministers, a truth teller to presidents.

754
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:04,113
他坚韧 他老谋深算
He's tough, he's wily,

755
00:39:05,197 --> 00:39:07,241
但他总是信守诺言
but he's always true to his word.

756
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:11,579
我三十年前开始做他的法律顾问
I arrived to give him legal advice 30 years ago,

757
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:13,163
至今也没离开
and I never got out the door.

758
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:18,919
时至今日 我很骄傲与他为友
And since that day, I'm proud to call him a friend.

759
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,300
那么 举杯吧
So, let's raise a toast.

760
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:25,926

763
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,521
我们也该玩那个游戏了
So, I think it's time to play the game.

764
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:39,899
要玩那个游戏吗
We're playing the game?

765
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:41,901
没错 是的
Well, yes.

766
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:46,363
今天是我的生日 当然要玩
It's my birthday, so yes, we're playing the game.

767
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:47,907
我们必须玩那个游戏吗
Do we have to play the game?

768
00:39:48,782 --> 00:39:49,909
那个游戏是什么
What's the game?

769
00:39:52,036 --> 00:39:53,621
到底是什么
What's the game?

770
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:01,587
天不错 你还好吗 格雷格
Nice day! You OK, Greg?

771
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:05,716
还好 我不... 车里还有地方吗
Sure. I'm not... Is there room in there?

772
00:40:07,843 --> 00:40:08,552
上车
Hop in.

773
00:40:16,685 --> 00:40:18,270
有点挤 抱歉
I'm sorry if it's a crush.

774
00:40:18,604 --> 00:40:19,313
没关系
It's fine.

775
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:24,985
我跟我祖父通了话
I was just talking to my grandpa.

776
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:27,613
他跟你说生日快乐
And he said happy birthday.

777
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:29,782
他说了吗
Did he?

778
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:33,202
好吧 理论上 他没说
Well, no, not technically,

779
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:35,371
但他知道你过生日
but he's aware it's your birthday.

780
00:40:35,746 --> 00:40:38,082
但跟他通话后 我突然想到
But it occurred to me, talking to him,

781
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:41,502
他仍在控股公司有席位
that him having his seat on the holding company still,

782
00:40:41,502 --> 00:40:43,420
这是历史遗留问题
from historically,

783
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:46,090
某种程度上讲 他不是最佳人选
now, that must be suboptimal, in some ways.

784
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:51,804
但如果我可以... 如果他愿意把这个位置
But if I could... if he was willing to give his seat

785
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:54,598
让更精明的人来接替
to someone a bit more perspicacious,

786
00:40:54,682 --> 00:40:58,352
让更熟悉门道的人来运营这些主题公园
someone who could learn the ropes, running a theme park, say.

787
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:00,354
运营这些游乐场
Running the parks?

788
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:02,815
交给年轻人 不断学习
Just a little guy. Learning, you know?

789
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:04,066
那个人选...
I mean, could that be...?

790
00:41:04,149 --> 00:41:05,818
你要是帮我 我...
You scratch my back, I...

791
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:08,696
虽说我并不能回报你什么
I'm not gonna say I could scratch yours.

792
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:11,532
因为这个范围太大了
It's be too considerable of a space.

793
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:13,951
但... 也许你能考虑下
But is there an angle there, perhaps?

794
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:17,514
儿子 你什么想法
So... what're you thinking, son?

795
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:19,433
对于这件事
On the thing?

796
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,978
她很聪明
She's very smart.

797
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:26,565
她是很好的人选 家人优先
She'd make good picks. Family first.

798
00:42:26,607 --> 00:42:28,025
我懂 我懂的
I'm sure. I'm sure.

799
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:32,488
那你为什么不高兴
But what's your cut?

800
00:42:34,114 --> 00:42:34,615
我没
Um... No.

801
00:42:34,698 --> 00:42:37,034
没有 我天 爸我没不高兴 这是你的公司
No. God no, Dad. No, it's your firm.

802
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:39,661
这跟我没什么关系
Like, it's not what's in it for me.

803
00:42:41,663 --> 00:42:45,209
不过 到底能不能有点关系
But you know, like, what is in it for me?

804
00:42:49,254 --> 00:42:50,923
我倒是想让你回公司
I'd love to get you back in.

805
00:42:50,923 --> 00:42:52,174
行 也行
Sure. No, sure.

806
00:42:52,174 --> 00:42:55,302
可上回不怎么样
It's just it was tough last time.

807
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:57,554
弗兰克在洛杉矶管我太严了
It was very tough with Frank over me in LA.

808
00:42:58,055 --> 00:42:59,890
弗兰克对公司很重要
Frank's very important to the firm.

809
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,850
可不是 很重要 当然 我理解
Oh, no, sure. No, of course, I understand that.

810
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,770
只不过 我在制片上有很多点子
It's just I had a lot of ideas at the studio.

811
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:07,564
你也知道 我是大创新思想家
As you know, I'm quite an innovative thinker,

812
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:11,485
可我遇到了很多阻力
and I was met with a lot of resistance.

813
00:43:13,904 --> 00:43:16,115
这还是因为节目吗
Is this still the film thing?

814
00:43:17,616 --> 00:43:19,910
不是... 你说机械奥运会吗
No... Oh, what, Robot Olympics?

815
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,163
不 爸 不只是这一个好点子
No, Dad, it's not about one fantastic idea.

816
00:43:23,163 --> 00:43:25,207
这是种文化 当时有很多这种点子
It was a culture. There were many of them.

817
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:27,709
你想怎样呢
What would be your dream outfit?

818
00:43:27,918 --> 00:43:30,170
我想做那节目的制片 非常想
I wanna run the damn show. I do.

819
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:33,215
运行起来以后 我要做首席运营官
And until it opens up, Chief Operating Officer.

820
00:43:34,716 --> 00:43:38,011
但我猜... 位置应该是弗兰克的 对吧
But I guess... I guess that's Frank, huh?

821
00:43:47,563 --> 00:43:48,397
你还好吗
You OK?

822
00:43:49,815 --> 00:43:51,984
不错 你呢
Sure. You?

823
00:44:10,252 --> 00:44:11,753
人都到了
The boys are here!

824
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:13,922
您这边走
Just right this way.

825
00:44:17,342 --> 00:44:18,927
这是我第一次坐直升机
That was my first helicopter ride.

826
00:44:19,928 --> 00:44:21,138
太疯狂了
It was so crazy.

827
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,557
比我想象的快多了
It goes so much faster than I thought.

828
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,933
见到你很高兴
Hey, it's good to see you.

829
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:31,523
好了 大家把手套戴好
OK, let's get a glove.

830
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:33,400
再给我倒点
Let's have a second.

831
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,322
几点了
What time is it?

832
00:44:43,994 --> 00:44:47,039
-往这扔  -回来 回来
- Toss it over here! - Come on back, come on back.

833
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:51,251
目前局势有些动荡 你要回公司吗
Now that things are getting shaken up, would you come inside?

834
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,213
爸 我不是随便搞搞政治
Dad, I'm not just playing with the politics.

835
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:56,798
对 当然 政治
Oh, no, of course. Politics.

836
00:44:57,466 --> 00:45:01,553
我不想说的太直白 但政治就是拉出来的屎
Not to be crude about it, but politics is what comes out the asshole.

837
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:04,389
明明回来有体面的工作 干嘛要去玩屎
Wouldn't you rather be up front, feeding the horse?

838
00:45:04,723 --> 00:45:07,017
乔伊丝表现地像我已经入主白宫了
Well, Joyce, she's got that Air Force One look.

839
00:45:07,392 --> 00:45:12,397
所以... 真要我回来帮忙 我必须万人之上
So... to come back, I'd want the top job.

840
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,234
但要是很难怎么办
And if that was difficult?

841
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:20,864
你要掌管所有海外的部分 游乐场等全部
Overseeing everything outside the US, parks and all.

842
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,118
什么... 你是说 做汤姆的老板
What, like... Tom's boss?

843
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:27,537
没错 垫脚石
Yeah. Stepping stones.

844
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,502
那来求救的小崽子到底要什么
What's the rescue pup looking for?

845
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:36,380
他搞砸了工作 需要帮助
He screwed up. Needs help.

846
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,258
他将来可能适合游乐场的管理
He might fit in eventually to the parks.

847
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:42,678
你觉得汤姆能处理好这种竞争吗
Do you think Tom can handle the competition?

848
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,265
罗伊先生 准备就绪
Mr. Roy. All set.

849
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,684
这就对了
There you go.

850
00:45:51,687 --> 00:45:52,312
那啥
Hey.

851
00:45:52,938 --> 00:45:55,399
我想把这个亲手交给您
So, just wanted to give this to you

852
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,568
当面跟您说声 生日快乐
in person just to say, you know, happy birthday.

853
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,903
帮我拿下
Hold that, will you?

854
00:46:05,534 --> 00:46:08,996
是块百达翡丽表...
It's just a Patek Philippe. So...

855
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,373
我知道 写着呢 "百达翡丽"
Yeah, it says "Patek Philippe."

856
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:12,666
是 我知道
Yeah. I know.

857
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:14,042
这表极其准
It's incredibly accurate.

858
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:15,168
每次你看向它
Every time you look at it,

859
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:16,795
都能准确展示你的富有
it tells you exactly how rich you are.

860
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:18,630
这话挺逗的
That's very funny.

861
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,466
刚这段你彩排过吗
Did you rehearse that?

862
00:46:22,884 --> 00:46:25,470
没 我没有 好吧 有 但是...
No. Well, no. Yes. But...

863
00:46:26,596 --> 00:46:28,807
好 还行
OK. Yeah.

864
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:30,517

Here.

865
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:33,395
好了 开始玩球了
OK, let's play ball.

866
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:37,316
好了 你们怎么想
So, what are you thinking?

867
00:46:37,566 --> 00:46:41,695
我想我们集体反对改信托人 一致对外
We say no, all of us, on the trust. Full block.

868
00:46:41,778 --> 00:46:43,780
要稳定 得按原计划来
Stability. Stick to the plan.

869
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:45,699
我上位 之后我们只要...
I take over and we just...

870
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:48,243
你俩 在我之下 做两位总裁
You two, under me, co-presidents.

871
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:49,953
-在你之下  -没错
- Under you? - Uh-huh.

872
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:52,831
但是 你懂的 我们三人并肩作战
But, you know, three. The power of three?

873
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:54,333
有趣
Interesting.

874
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:56,209
-我们能想下吗  -当然
- Can we think about it? - Of course.

875
00:46:56,209 --> 00:46:57,794

876

- Change sides! - Hey, man.

882
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:13,060
跟跳芭蕾一样
It was balletic, though,

883
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:14,144

-打中了  -孩子 快跑
- That's it. - Run, kid!

967
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,947
-打中了  -飞得真远
- That's a hit. - That's a damn hit.

968
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:56,283

970
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:02,205
快 快 再跑快点
Come on! Come on, run faster!

971
00:51:04,207 --> 00:51:07,502
-不  -孩子 运气不好
- No! No! - Bad luck, kid.

972
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:12,340
你就差那么一点点
Oh, no! You were so damn close!

973
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:14,259
就那么一点点
That was so close!

974
00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:15,969
天啊
Oh, my goodness!

975
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:19,514
真可怜 但不好意思
Oh, that is so sad! Oh, I'm sorry.

976
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:21,725
钱不能给你了 顺便说句 钱差点就是你的了
I can't give it to you. That would have counted, by the way.

977
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:23,935
如果你刚跑完了 就真的是全垒打了
That was almost a home run, if you went all the way around.

978
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:25,353
不过你真的努力了
But it was a really good effort.

979
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:26,771
真的 很精彩
Really. Quite tremendous.

980
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:28,690
拿着这个 回到你的生活
So take this back to your life.

981
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,775
这是一百万的四分之一 好好享受
It's a quarter million. Enjoy.

982
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:35,447
孩子... 打得很棒
Son... magnificent effort.

983
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:37,115
-谢谢  -很棒
- Thank you. - Magnificent.

984
00:51:40,368 --> 00:51:42,579
-来这里  -没关系的
- Come here. - It's OK.

985
00:52:03,016 --> 00:52:04,476
劳伦斯
Hey, Lawrence.

986
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:06,811
真可惜那个提案失败了
Sorry the other offer fell through.

987
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:09,064
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what happened.

988
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:11,399
不过待宰的羊已经养肥了 是吧
But we fattened the goose nice now, right?

989
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,193
我给你1.4亿
The number is 140.

990
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:15,737
现金 股票也可以
Cash, with a stock alternative.

991
00:52:17,405 --> 00:52:18,615
你加入我们
You're on our board.

992
00:52:19,366 --> 00:52:21,326
股票到手 你会分到一份不错的羹
Take the stock, you'll own a nice piece of us.

993
00:52:21,326 --> 00:52:24,287
好吧 这提议很诱人
Well, that is an appealing package.

994
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:27,582
你说得没错 是很诱人
It is, yeah. It's appealing.

995
00:52:27,874 --> 00:52:30,043
但你最好想清楚 因为我代表整个公司
You better play nice, though. Because I'm the whole company.

996
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:31,336
当然 我觉得你不会走的
Yeah, I think you're gonna stick around

997
00:52:31,336 --> 00:52:33,213
因为我会在你嘴里塞满了钱
because I'm gonna stuff your mouth with so much money

998
00:52:33,213 --> 00:52:35,215
你拉屎都拉的小金人
you're gonna shit gold figurines.

999
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:39,511
保密协议 无表决权股票 竞业禁止
Non-disclosure agreement. Non-voting shares. Non-compete.

1000
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:43,473
你会被我关进金笼子 屁眼里插满银阴茎
I'm going to lock you in a golden cage, fuck you with a silver dildo,

1001
00:52:43,473 --> 00:52:46,101
收着我的钱 唱我想听的歌
and pay you so much you sing whatever song I want.

1002
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:49,270
-别急 你还需要我的推荐  -不 我不需要
- Easy. You still need me to recommend this. - No, I don't.

1003
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:52,190
因为我的提案太他妈好了 你不得不接受
This is a deal so fucking good you have to take it,

1004
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,650
否则我们法庭见
or we'll see you in court.

1005
00:52:54,484 --> 00:52:55,402
哥们
Dude.

1006
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:13,878
你还好吗 先生 事情还顺利吗
How you doing, sir? How's everything?

1007
00:53:13,878 --> 00:53:18,049
我叫科林 我为洛根·罗伊先生和他的家族工作
I'm Colin. I work for Mr. Logan Roy and the Roy family.

1008
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:22,053
我们希望您能对今天的事保密
We'd like to keep this quiet today, if you'll agree to that.

1009
00:53:22,387 --> 00:53:24,848
我们希望和您签订一份保密协议
We'd like to have you sign a non-disclosure agreement.

1010
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:27,851
-你想再干五年吗  -对 弗兰克
- You wanted five? - Oh, Frank. Yeah.

1011
00:53:28,476 --> 00:53:30,937
我一直在想
I've been thinking

1012
00:53:31,563 --> 00:53:36,192
现在 是不是该给你分配新职位
if now isn't a time for a new role for you.

1013
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:40,530
好吧 什么职位
OK. As in what sort?

1014
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,990
轻松点的
Light duties.

1015
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:46,411
轻松的
Light duties.

1016
00:53:49,205 --> 00:53:52,792
你耍我吗 洛根 开我
Are you kidding me? Logan. Me?

1017
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:55,754
你手机应该收到了一封任命信
There should be a press release on your phone.

1018
00:53:56,629 --> 00:53:57,464
看看吧
Proof it.

1019
00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:01,551
你可能想再润色下 写得挺直白的
You might want to give it a bit of color, it's quite dry.

1020
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,645
就这样吗 这样对我 都过了30...
That's it? To me. That's it? After 30...

1021
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:15,231
老天 就在这林子里
Jesus Christ. Here?

1022
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:20,945
你是你的所为 洛根 你知道吗
You are what you do, Logan. You know that?

1023
00:54:22,197 --> 00:54:24,741
最终 你只不过是你的所为
In the end, you're just what you do.

1024
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:27,744
别担心 你会拿到补贴
Don't worry, you'll get your nut.

1025
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:30,121
康纳
Connor!

1026
00:54:30,413 --> 00:54:32,749
小西 罗曼
Shiv! Roman!

1027
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:34,417
坐那架直升机
The other helicopter.

1028
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:37,086
科林 交给你了
Colin, see to it.

1029
00:54:57,398 --> 00:55:01,778
截止日期已经正式过了
Well, officially the deadline has passed.

1030
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:05,240
所以... 你们怎么想
So... what do you say, kids?

1031
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,825
弗兰克什么情况
What's the Frank situation?

1032
00:55:07,617 --> 00:55:08,910
弗兰克与我们无关了
Frank's out of the picture.

1033
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:10,745
怎么
Yeah?

1034
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:14,290
他出局了 由汤姆接替
Frank's dead. Tom's stepping up,

1035
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:16,209
小西也在考虑一个新职位
and Shiv's thinking about a new role.

1036
00:55:16,626 --> 00:55:18,670
所以 都满意了吗
So, are we good?

1037
00:55:20,296 --> 00:55:22,423
小西觉得呢
Um... Shiv?

1038
00:55:24,843 --> 00:55:25,927
小罗
Rome?

1039
00:55:26,678 --> 00:55:27,637
康纳
Con?

1040
00:55:29,472 --> 00:55:31,683
我听他俩的 他们说了算
I'm with these two. What they say goes.

1041
00:55:35,019 --> 00:55:37,689
我们认为这对我们没什么用
Our position is this doesn't quite work for us.

1042
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:38,773
就目前来说
At present.

1043
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:40,608
你说啥
You what?

1044
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:44,153
作为一个提议来说 还不够吸引人
It's not sufficiently attractive as a proposition.

1045
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:45,989
你们他妈扯淡呢
Are you fuckin' joking?

1046
00:55:45,989 --> 00:55:47,490
我们懂的 真的
We get that. We do.

1047
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:50,034
而且我们也很乐意帮忙 尤其我
And we would love to help. I would love to help.

1048
00:55:50,034 --> 00:55:50,869
那帮啊
Then help.

1049
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:53,830
但我们连权力都失去了 为什么还要帮你
But why would I when I'm giving away power?

1050
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:54,956
有什么理由这么做
Why would I do that?

1051
00:55:55,206 --> 00:55:58,668
-那...让凯莉  -凯莉是谁
- So... so Kelly, uh... - Who's Kelly?

1052
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:00,336
让凯莉准备一些数据
Kelly will set up some figures.

1053
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:03,631
-他应该看到...  -爸
- He should see that, uh... - Dad?

1054
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,550
-爸  -对 他...
- Dad? - Yeah, he...

1055
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,552
爸 这只是初始意愿 爸
Dad, it's just a first position. Dad?

1056
00:56:07,552 --> 00:56:10,638
能领会... 那个...
Get a grasp of what... what...

1057
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:14,142
-爸 爸  -爸
- Dad! Dad! - Dad!

1058
00:56:17,437 --> 00:56:18,354
爸
Dad!

1059
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:21,858
-爸 爸  -爸
- Dad! Dad! - Dad! Dad!

1060
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:26,362
去医院 把我们送到医院
Just, yeah. A hospital. Take us to a hospital.

1061
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:27,739
马上
OK, yeah, now!

1062
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:28,823
他昏过去了吗
Has he fainted?

1063
00:56:28,823 --> 00:56:31,743
-他昏过去了 他身上好烫  -真的很烫 怎么回事
- He fainted? He's hot. - He's really hot. I don't know.

1064
00:56:50,637 --> 00:56:52,347
-肯德尔  -怎么了
- Kendall? - Yeah.

1065
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,390
你听说那消息了吗
Have you heard the news?

1066
00:56:55,058 --> 00:56:55,808

It's all very exciting. I can't wait to...

1069
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,026
-我们成交了吗  -是的
- We got a deal? - Yeah.

1070
00:57:05,026 --> 00:57:06,569
-说真的  -真的
- Serious? - Yes?

1071
00:57:06,903 --> 00:57:08,279
哥们
Oh, dude.

1072
00:57:08,947 --> 00:57:10,782
听着 我觉得...
Listen, I think...

1073
00:57:11,115 --> 00:57:13,159
你做了非常明智的决定
I think you've made a really great decision

1074
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:16,704
我希望你不要介意我刚说的那些话
and I hope there's no hard feelings over all the shit-talking.

1075
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:18,456
不会 没关系
Oh, no, no, it's cool.

1076
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:19,791
没事的
It's cool.

1077
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,211
我刚说的消息是
So, the news I was talking about

1078
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:26,089
你父亲刚突发脑溢血
is that your dad just had a brain hemorrhage.

1079
00:57:28,174 --> 00:57:28,925
什么

1080
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:31,552

- Are you... - But...

1082
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:37,475
你就在刚才引狼入室
you just invited me into the chicken coop.

1083
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:39,811
没有你老爸来保护你
And without Daddy around to protect you,

1084
00:57:39,811 --> 00:57:41,145
我会把你们所有人吃干抹净
I'm gonna eat you all.

1085
00:57:41,729 --> 00:57:43,106
一个接着一个
One by fucking one.

1086
00:57:56,202 --> 00:57:57,036
喂
Hello?

00:57:57,245 --> 00:57:58,913
肯德尔 你终于接了
Kendall. Thank God.

1088
00:57:59,497 --> 00:58:01,207
我们一直在联系你...
We've been trying to reach you. Um...

1089
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:04,711
爸进医院了
Dad is in the hospital.

1090
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:05,837
他...
He's...

1091
00:58:06,254 --> 00:58:09,549
我们刚在直升机里 很快到了医院
We were in the helicopter, and we got here really fast,

1092
00:58:09,549 --> 00:58:11,050
但他们认为...
but they think...

1093
00:58:11,217 --> 00:58:13,594
还不确定 但医生认为他突发了脑溢血
We don't know. They think he's had a brain hemorrhage.

1094
00:58:20,143 --> 00:58:22,437
如果你能现在赶过来
If you could get here really soon,

1095
00:58:22,437 --> 00:58:23,855
那就太好了
that'd be good.

1096
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,190
对不起
I'm sorry.

1097
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:14,155
多数首次购房买家选择新港海滩
Most first-time homebuyers would love to live in Newport Beach.

但新港海滩的均价超过一百万美金
But average home price in Newport Beach is over $1 million.

1099
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:20,328
所以 大多数房产...

1100
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:45,269
出现了一定幅度的股票波动
